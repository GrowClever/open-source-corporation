# Mission

These are the reasons for the Company to exist. The mission statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to these items to justify our projects and other pages of this manual. The mission should be reviewed at least quarterly.

  * *empower creation on the web*
  * *A widget in every website* become the go-to platform for publishing and installing web widgets.

# Values

  * *culture* - Create an open culture of: feedback and support, critical thinking (asking why?), experimentation and taste. By taste, we mean people who have opinions about why things should be done a certain way, and who try to see potential and continuously clarify that vision of what's right, and improve towards it at the same time.
  * *prototyping* exciting opportunities for big impact.
  * *relationships* built on trust established through shared values and results
  * *deep domain understanding* (supports A2) Understand clients' long term business goals deeply in order to improve design choices.
  * *transparency* [more here](./TRANSPARENCY.md)
  * *make remote work better* ie.) Flexible work hours and location.

## Discussion

This addresses some questions raised by the team.

B2. Web technology work includes usability and other practical delivery considerations [jvo]. The strategy is to systematically review what we spend our time on and try to automate it and make it disappear through convention and best practices. This doesn't mean we'll use the word "web technology" with customers at all [hk]. It's an internal and accurate term. For marketing speak, a better catchall for web tech is "cloud".

B3. Based on feedback, we've removed the specific aim of 50 million users, and changed our goal to win a specific market. Getting specific numbers of users is still a useful metric but not really the mission. It was asked what our strategy is for this, and the key strategy is the use of a backlink as marketing in the widget code for non-paying users. This has been effective in other cases. Also, the use of keyword rich domains specific to each widget is very effective for SEO [gr]. Doubling our user base every 3 months is about the right order of magnitude to aim for in terms of velocity. We want to reach that as soon as possible after we shift to this project a bit more, starting soon, in full swing by July. [tj]
