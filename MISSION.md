# Mission

These are the reasons for the Company to exist. The mission statement also says a lot what's left out, and that's what makes it useful. It helps us get on the same page regarding what we care about so we can work towards the same things and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit.

  1. Develop mutually rewarding relationships with clients where we contribute to their successful business outcomes in order to earn our billables and future contracts.
 2. Re-imagine standard ways companies engage with web technology work, creating a system for web technology contract work that's better for all parties involved.
 3. Become the number one hosted platform "app store" for "front end embeddable / 3rd party" web technologies. The closest existing thing is like Google Tag Manager. Wordpress plugins are an adjacent but not direct competitior.
 4. Become a workplace that independent-minded, creative, tasteful knowledge workers prefer. _can this be more specific?_

# Principles

To help us get there:

  * _The Collaboration Principle_ - Collaborate with clients to exceed (ideally by orders of magniutude) a 300% ROI on the client's investment in our billables.
  * _The Disrutption Principle_ - Do work that excites us and has a chance to affect change in its' industry.
  * _The Direction Principle_ - Collaborate to keep and updated list of specific opportunities shared with our team.
  * _The Transparency Principle_ - Share everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _The Systems Principle_ - Continuously work on improving our processes to create a productive work environment.
  * _The Clarity Principle_ - Strive to achieve *clarity* in all that we do. The founder (Clark Van Oyen) believes a lack of clarity (ambiguity, uncertainty and lack of the right communication) to be the number one cause of failure in software projects overall.
