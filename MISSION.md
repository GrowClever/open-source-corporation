These are the reasons for the Company to exist. The mission statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to these items to justify our projects and other pages of this manual. The mission should be reviewed at least quarterly.
