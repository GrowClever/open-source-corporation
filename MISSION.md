# Mission

These are the reasons for the Company to exist. The mission statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to these items to justify our projects and other pages of this manual. The mission should be reviewed at least quarterly.

 1. Develop rewarding relationships with clients in which we contribute to their successful business outcomes. Understand the client's business in order to improve technology choices. [gr]
 2. Re-imagine standard ways companies engage with web technology work, creating a system for web technology contract work that's more transparent, efficient, and effective for all parties involved.
 3. Become the number one hosted platform (app store) for front end embeddable 3rd party web technologies (widgets). The closest existing thing is like Google Tag Manager. Wordpress plugins are an adjacent but not direct competitior.
 4. Foster a culture of openness, support, critical thinking, creativity and taste. By taste, we mean people who have opinions about why things should be done a certain way, and who try to see potential and continuously clarify that vision of what's right, and improve towards it at the same time.
 5. Become the ideal workplace to support the people who fit into #4 above.

## Discussion

This addresses some questions raised by the team.

#1 - Strategy is mostly pending discussion. Making our work as transparent as possible [jvo] (and hilight relevant information to clients to prevent confusion) will be part of this. Find ways to get feedback from clients [hk].

#2 - Web technology work includes usability and other practical delivery considerations [jvo]. The strategy is to systematically review what we spend our time on and try to automate it and make it disappear through convention and best practices. This doesn't mean we'll use the word "web technology" with customers at all [hk]. It's an internal and accurate term. For marketing speak, a better catchall for web tech is "cloud".

#3 - Based on feedback, we've removed the specific aim of 50 million users, and changed our goal to win a specific market. Getting specific numbers of users is still a useful metric but not really the mission. It was asked what our strategy is for this, and the key strategy is the use of a backlink as marketing in the widget code for non-paying users. This has been effective in other cases. Also, the use of keyword rich domains specific to each widget is very effective for SEO [gr]. Doubling our user base every 3 months is about the right order of magnitude to aim for in terms of velocity. We want to reach that as soon as possible after we shift to this project a bit more, starting soon, in full swing by May. [tj]

#4 - Strategy is mostly pending discussion. Includes the ability to have flexible hours and location, good feedback, good mentorship and guidance, clear objectives, interesting projects. Let's discuss to figure out what we each value most in this regard. [gr]
