# Mission

These are the reasons for the Company to exist. The mission statement also says a lot by what's left out, and that's what makes it useful. It helps us get on the same page regarding what we care about so we can work towards the same things and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit.

  1. Develop mutually rewarding relationships with clients where we contribute to their successful business outcomes in order to earn our billables and future contracts.
 2. Re-imagine standard ways companies engage with web technology work, creating a system for web technology contract work that's better for all parties involved.
 3. Become the number one hosted platform "app store" for "front end embeddable / 3rd party" web technologies. The closest existing thing is like Google Tag Manager. Wordpress plugins are an adjacent but not direct competitior.
 4. Become a workplace that independent-minded, creative, tasteful knowledge workers prefer. _can this be more specific?_
