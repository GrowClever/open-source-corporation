# Mission

These are the reasons for the Company to exist.

  * Reach 50 million users on our web widget platform products.
  * Develop mutually rewarding relationships with clients.
  * Become a workplace that independent-minded, creative, tasteful knowledge workers prefer.

# Principles

To help us get there:

  * Collaborate with clients to exceed (ideally by orders of magniutude) a 300% ROI on the client's investment in our billables.
  * Do work that excites us and has a chance to affect change in its' industry.
  * Keep an updated list of specific opportunities shared with our team.
  * Share everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * *The Systems Principle* Continuously work on improving our processes to create a productive work environment.
  * Strive to achieve *clarity* in all that we do. The founder (Clark Van Oyen) believes a lack of clarity (ambiguity, uncertainty and lack of the right communication) to be the number one cause of failure in software projects overall.
