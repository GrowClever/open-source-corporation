Overarching mission: _Empower Creation on the WEb._

We currently have 2.

  * _Give our clients the best web technology and web presence in their industry_: Clients should be able to confidently show off their web technology as best in class, and rapidly experiment with new ways to leverage web technology.
  * _A widget in every website_: Empower creation on the web, and become the go-to platform for publishing and installing web widgets.

The mission statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to this mission to justify our projects and other pages of this manual. The mission should be reviewed quarterly.
