# Mission

We currently have 2.

  * *A widget in every website* empower creation on the web, and become the go-to platform for publishing and installing web widgets.
  * *Make web development easy and fun* - Rethink, reinvent and automate every aspect of the web development process.

The mission statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to this mission to justify our projects and other pages of this manual. The mission should be reviewed at least quarterly.
