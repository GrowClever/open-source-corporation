# DevOps

## Purpose

The purpose of DevOps is that software should always be deployed and tested reliably and automatically in a way that helps us and our customers.

DevOps is the practice of writing code and configurations to accomplish this.

## Scope

This page introduces the areas we call DevOps at countable.

## Specific Goals of DevOps

1. Every code project should be deployed automatically, reliably and predictably (by the devs and clients) to production.
1. Every code project should automatically be tested whenever the code is changes, and the results should be sent to the team (on Slack).
1. We want to minimize the effort in setting up a new environment (dev, prod, CI, stage). These should be as automatic as possible.
1. Every code project should be "staged" automatically whenever the code changes (in the `develop` branch) so anyone can see the bleeding edge version in order to discuss, test, and understand ongoing work.
1. Setting up a new server or developer laptop should be quick and painless.
1. We should have a collecting of shared scripts that automate any tedious task developers need to accomplish.
