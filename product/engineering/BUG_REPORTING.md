These are the required steps for reportings bugs at Countable.

1. Briefly describe the current behaviour and how it differs from the desired behaviour.
2. Include the exact URL where the issue can be observed.
3. Note what browser/device you are using.
4. List any further steps (specific clicks, etc) to observe the issue.
5. For aesthetic problems, take a screenshot and circle the problem in red.
6. For text problems, quote the problematic text.
7. Use a red "bug" label in Trello to mark bugs.
8. Assign the bug to someone who can either fix or triage it.
