# User Experience Design

(draft)

## Scope
Countable takes a Human Centered Design approach in its user experience process.

## Purpose
Maximize the usefulness of our work product to its end users.

## Process

There are three major phases: User Research, Prototyping and Feedback. These will overlap and repeat to some extent.

## User Research

It's valuable to front-load much of the user research in a software project so other work can be informed by information about real users, not our assumptions.

### Personas and Interviews
First, identify the people who will interact with the work product (Personas). Ideally, find a real person who embodies each persona and stay in contact with them to collect feedback throughout the product development.
Interview representatives of each Persona to answer the following:
  * What problem are you solving for the persona? Why does that problem matter to them? What words do they use to describe the problem?
  * What is your Persona currently doing about this problem (prior to your solution)?
  * Take advantage of your "Fresh eyes" at this time, to identify needs does the user have that they're not consciously aware of. It's fine if you turn out to be wrong about these, just write them down to validate later.

### Stories
  * Write user stories. This is a functional spec of your software. Be clear about what is should do for users.
  * Validate your stories with the product owner and users, and adjust.
  
## Prototyping
  * Create wireframes that support the important user stories. Validate these against conversations with the target market.
  * Validate your stories with the product owner and users, and adjust.
  * You're now ready to hand off the wireframes to technical team members to develop a [functional prototype](./PROTOTYPING.md)

## Feedback
  * Conduct [usability tests](./USABILITY_TESTING.md).
