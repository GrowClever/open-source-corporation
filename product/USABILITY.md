# Usability Testing

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to ensure thorough and standardized usability tests can be followed by any member of the team (or any other user), allowing Countable to better test its products.  The top priority is currently to create a guide which is easy to follow. We'll know we've succeeded when anyone can conduct these tests and give feedback which can be used by the product dev(s) to advance the prototype.

## Scope

This document standardizes the process of Usability Testing. The process aims to evaluate a product’s capacity to meet its intended purpose.  

## How To Test a Product’s Usability

The following are questions to ask while Usability Testing:

Is the product under evaluation efficient enough (Are the users able to carry out their task while expending reasonable resources such as time, cognitive or physical demand)?
Is it effective enough (Can the user complete the tasks they are supposed to perform with the tool? Is their performance complete and accurate?)?
Is it sufficiently satisfactory for the users (What is the users’ attitude towards the system? Do they experience discomfort?)?
