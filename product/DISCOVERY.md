# Project Discovery

## Purpose

Our first job on a project is to create a clear shared vision, and make rapid progress towards product-market fit.

## Scope

Checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

## Kick-off Meeting
  
For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these critical questions.

  * What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a list of the personas, and high level stories (also called value hypothesis or value proposition).
  * What is the most important benefit you expect this project to provide to the user?
  * How will success be measured?
  * What is the impact hypothesis using the above metric? How many people will use the solution, and how does it impact their lives/jobs? How can that be maximized?
  * What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much detail as possible about that vision.
  * Who will we need to work with and in what capacity? (make a list) Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
  * What are the first key deliverables and to whom, in order to accelerate the project?

Consider the Business Model Canvas, as a visual guide for this process.

## User Experience Design (UX)

The next phase ofthe project after discovery is to engage in [user experience design](./USER_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN.md).

## For Branding and Visual Design Projects
  * Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are close to what they want.
  * Use the branding questionnaire.
  * If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual primitives if new ones needed.
  * Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
