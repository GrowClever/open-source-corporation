# Project Discovery

## Purpose

Our first job on a project is to create a clear shared vision. Make quick progress towards product-market fit on a new project.

## Scope

Checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

## Process (Kick-off Meeting)
  
  * For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these critical questions.
  * What problem does this project solve, for whom? (value hypothesis)
  * What is the most important benefit you expect this project to provide to the user?
  * What is the growth hypothesis? How will the project virally grow (by referrals) to reach more people?
  * What does success look like for you? Provide as much detail as possible about that vision.
  * How will success be measured?
  * Proceed to the next section (UX)

## User Experience Design (UX)

The next phase ofthe project after discovery is to engage in [user experience design](./USER_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN.md).

## For Branding and Visual Design Projects
  * Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are close to what they want.
  * If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual primitives if new ones needed.
  * Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
