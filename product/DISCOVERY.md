# Project Discovery

## Purpose

Our first job on a project is to create a clear shared vision. Make quick progress towards product-market fit on a new project.

## Scope

Checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

## Required Steps for Project Discovery
  
  * For this session, meet the product owner (client) in person or over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these critical questions. [1]
  * What problem does this project solve, for whom? (value hypothesis)
  * What is the most important benefit you expect this project to provide to the user?
  * What is the growth hypothesis? How will the project virally grow (by referrals) to reach more people?
  * What does success look like for you? Provide as much detail as possible about that vision.
  * How will success be measured?
  * Identify the target market (persona). ideally, find a real person who embodies the persona.
  * What problem are you solving for the persona? Why does that problem matter to them? What words do they use to describe the problem?
  * What is your Persona currently doing about this problem (prior to your solution)?
  * Write user stories. This is a functional spec of your software. be clear about what is should do for users.
  * Create wireframes that support the important user stories. Validate these against conversations with the target market.

# For Branding and Visual Design Projects
  * Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are close to what they want.
  * If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual primitives if new ones needed.
  * Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
