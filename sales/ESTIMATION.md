# Estimation

# Purpose

We don't provide quotes except on large projects. This is because new scope is nearly always added, invalidating the quote and requiring a change management process which wastes time, especially when deadlines are close. The cost of missing a deadline or having to manage updates to a small quote is astronomically higher than the cost of the original work. Worse, it distracts our focus from doing excellent work instead to meeting an arbitrary cost number. Instead, our process for controlling cost on a small project like this is:

# Effort Estimation Process

1) We offer a ballpark estimate of hours, with the implicit understanding that any revisions not originally requested will require a bit more time. What works pretty well is to DOUBLE the original number and you'll be pretty close to actuals 95% of the time.
2) If we expect to go over the estimate, we flag this for you asap. In this case, we'll normally assume we should keep working unless you indicate you want to chop some scope instead.
3) If you perceive the billed amount unreasonable or something you didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we also often finish early which balances out.
4) If you make any request (ie, email) for technical work (anything not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of small requests since it's much less efficient that way.
