# Estimation

Software project estimation is [notoriously difficult](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html).

# Purpose

We don't provide quotes except on large projects. This is because new scope is nearly always added, invalidating the quote and requiring a change management process which wastes time, especially when deadlines are close. The cost of missing a deadline or having to manage updates to a small quote is astronomically higher than the cost of the original work. Worse, it distracts our focus from doing excellent work instead to meeting an arbitrary cost number. Instead, we'd rather offer ballpark estimates, have great communication throughout the project about [velocity](https://www.scruminc.com/velocity/) and then guarantee satisfaction with our work. If we can't do that, the client shouldn't be our client so it helps us stick to work the leverages our strengths and where we can produce fantastic results.

# Effort Estimation Process

1) We offer a ballpark estimate of hours, with the implicit understanding that any revisions not originally requested will require a bit more time. What works pretty well is to DOUBLE the original number and you'll be pretty close to actuals 95% of the time.
2) If we expect to go over the estimate, we flag this for you asap. In this case, we'll normally assume we should keep working unless you indicate you want to chop some scope instead.
3) If the client finds the billed amount unreasonable or something you didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we also often finish early which balances out.
4) If you make any request (ie, email) for technical work (anything not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of small requests since it's much less efficient that way.
5) We normally want 1 week of lead time to deliver items up to 2 days of effort. For larger items, we want a week lead time before starting, and deadlines will be managed via agile process (no hard deadline for specific scope, only identify launch dates and other notable dates with desired stories to be filled by then, the team can then focus on delivering the user stories as quickly and well as possible).
6) Break down the task description by 1 day items.
