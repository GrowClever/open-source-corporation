# Estimation

# Purpose

Software project cost estimation is [notoriously difficult](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html). A typical problem is the team appears to have 70% of the information when estimating a project, when they really have 30% because by definition, they can't see black swan conditions (unknown unknowns).

The purpose is to recognize this constraint, and set expectations and contracts accordingly.

# Scope

Define our approach and guidelines for software project cost estimation.

# Effort Estimation Process

For all projects:
  * Make sure you summarize the purpose of the work at the top of any estimation document. You can't repeat this too many times.
  * Tell the client what you need by when to finish within the budget.
  * Determine their deadline, and build a prototype within 25% of the alloted time. 

## Small Task Estimation (under 5 days)

  * For small projects, if clients require an estimate, estimate double the number of technical work hours you see. This allows for communication and small misunderstandings. It's relatively accurate for creating a budget (total hours) and deadline.
  * Summarize the high level technical steps (in approximately 1-day line items) you will take.

## Bigger Project Estimation (5 or more days)

  * Summarize the high level technical work (in 1 to 5 days line items)
  * Identify uncertainties and risks. One such uncertainty is that you've made many assumptions in the line items above.
  * Explain that to mitigate uncertainty, we will build a prototype. This may include wireframes, clickable mock-ups, and/or a bare bones application. Every project MUST implement at least one of these within 25% of the time to the final deadline.

## Ongoing Work
  * Some clients require ongoing technical work.
  * If there's over 40 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting every week.
  * If there's at least 20 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting every 2 weeks.
  * If there's at least 10 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting once per month.
  * We normally want 1 week of lead time to deliver items up to 2 days of effort. For larger items, we want a week lead time before starting, and deadlines will be managed via agile process (no hard deadline for specific scope, only identify launch dates and other notable dates with desired stories to be filled by then, the team can then focus on delivering the user stories as quickly and well as possible).
  * Any additional request (ie, via email) for technical work (anything not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of small requests since it's much less efficient that way.

## During the Project

  * During the project, if we expect to exceed the budget, tell the client and your manager ASAP, and explain what happened.
  * If the client finds the billed amount unreasonable or something you didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we also often finish early which balances out. If it happens a lot and can't be solved by communication, the client is a bad fit forus, and we shouldn't be working with them. Inability to communicate on budgets is a useful way to identify a bad client relationship.
