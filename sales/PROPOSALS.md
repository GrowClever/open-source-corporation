# How To Increase Proposal Win Rate

## Purpose

Improve the ROI of time spent writing proposals.

## Scope

Actionable tactics for achieving the above purpose. The author is most experienced writing proposals for the public sector.

## Principles

  * The process starts before you start writing. You want to make sure the odds are stacked in your favour before you invest in writing anything.
  * Specialize! Choose similar projects, so you can re-use bits of old proposals that worked. It's better to solve the same problem really well than to spread yourself thin. Choose an RFP in an area where you have the most expertise, similar work (including successes to hilight), and have a network of people in that area.
  * Use your network's experience. If you know someone who would be really great to add to your team, write them into the proposal too, and give them a small cut just for being present, even if they do very little work. It's better to win more proposals and share the revenue. Also, get them (or someone who understand the client) to review your proposal and give you a score before you submit.
  * Find out who the front runner is. Is there an established company other than you that's won similar projects in this area? What vendors have the client used for similar projects before? Who has beat you on similar RFPs before? An easy way to find the frontrunner is to look at the addendum which is usually submitted shortly after the RFP is posted with an answer to questions asked by proponents.
  * Ask questions to qualify or disqualify the project, before writing. Your questions should also unearth hidden desires behind the RFP. Find out the truth about whether you can knock it out of the park. You may not like the answer but it's better to find out now and save yourself from wasting time being disqualified later. Examples "Would you consider a team outside your industry who can bring fresh ideas, or prefer lots of industry experience?"
  * If there's actual scoring criteria, you can forget much of the above, and just focus nearly 100% on that. But keep in mind those criteria will often overlap with other principles here.
  * Keep the proposal as short as possible while addressing the criteria and building trust.
  * Focus on how you can differentiate.

## Process

### RFP Lead Capture

See [Filter](./FILTER.md)

### Pre-qualify

1. Determine who is the "frontrunner" ,most likely to bid and win the project. Is there a strong off-the-shelf solution which is compatible. If so, is there a local supplier? Find frontrunner. What is the industry "state of the art" in this area. What is being used by others? What companies have won similar projects in the past. If you can't see an applicant list, assume such a company will be applying.
1. Review all evaluation criteria. What is the estimated score we could get on the project? Is it within 5% of frontrunner's estimated score? If not, move on.
1. Does the RFP lean towards a custom software solution or off-the-shelf existing product? Based on that, can we deliver what they prefer? If not, move on.
1. Estimate bid size, based on beating the frontrunner's score by 5%. If there's no budget for the project, estimate one based on past similar projects by the frontrunner, prospect, and software category. Is this amount profitable? If not, move on.

### Qualify

You'll want to ask 2 or 3 questions before writing in order be confident about the project. Ideally, get on the phone with someone in order to make a "conceptual agreement". This won't always be possible. The goals are to get the interest and then the guidance of the buyer, and understand their priorities. Demonstrate a genuine interest in the outcome of the project.

1. Make a super clear, one sentence statement of the real problem the RFP wants to solve, in language you understand. Ask the prospect if this is the most important thing, and if not, what is?
1. Make a super clear, one sentence statement of your unique approach. Ask the prospect if it's a good approach.
1. Think of any possible reason your proposal might not be accepted. This is hard, but important. Ask a question for each uncertainty to determine if it's likely, or not.
1. Ask questions to clarify any scoring criteria so you're 100% clear what they each mean.
1. Ask questions to help you understand what the evaluators are looking for.
1. If the project solves a real problem, there should be an existing (partial, bad) solution. Ask "How are you currently getting by without this solution? What process will we be replacing?".
1. Get clarity on anything that might disqualify you.

### Research

This is pretty dependent on the proposal, but the main goals are:

1. Further clarify your chances of winning.
1. Get the information you need to improve your chances of winning.

### Deciding to Write

With all the above done, you should now determine whether to write, or move on to a new RFP. You should know your approximate chances of winning, the value of the contract, and your alternatives, and make the best choice.

Are you the frontrunner? If not, can you propose a solution that is better in some way that matters to the prospect? The answer to one of these questions should be YES if you want to write. You must believe you have a good chance of winning based on all the information so far.

### Outline

Copy most if not all of the original proposal into a Google Doc, invite everyone who will work on it, and proceed to copy the structure of the original RFP as your proposal structure. Write your proposal inline to the original RFP.

Write responses inline to the original RFP and mirror RFP document structure. Then, add the following sections if they're not already there, but keep them very small/simple.
  * In the intro, summarize the real needs underlying the proposal.
  * Indicate why your company is specifically interested in this project and its results.
  * What makes your solution unique?
  * High level summary of your approach, with evidence from past projects that it will work.
  * How will a successful outcome be measured?

### Angle

Now that you know the most important thing they want to achieve from your questions, you must create an "angle". This means you should create some uncertainty that competitors will deliver what matters, by emphasizing what's unique about your team's ability to solve the problem.

In particular, if you're not the frontrunner, this is critical. Plant a seed of doubt about the frontrunner and build on that. A good one is that as a newcomer you can provide more customization because your product is still more flexible and early in its development lifecycle.

If you are the a frontrunner, point to your past successes. Your angle is to create concern that other solutions don't have as much evidence of ability to deliver. 


### Team

Include photos and some personal notes that relate each team member to the project, and their relevant past successes.

### Case Studies

  * Hilight their industry, location and other parts of their identity. Draw attention to the relevance of your prior work, and leave out details that don't indicate how similar your prior projects are to the current RFP, or how successful they were.
  
### Platform

List features of your platform that align with the real problems behind the RFP, and for each feature, list the benefits which solve those problems.

### Addressing Criteria

If the RFP has scoring criteria already, this should be your focus.

Don't try to be clever and make up a proposal structure based on your domain knowledge. Instead, write your proposal inline to the original RFP, and include the original wording in a different font. This will make it easy to mark, clear you've missed no mandatory criteria, and clear how to score you.

In each section, the person creating the outline should make a note of the person from our team best qualified to write that section so it's very clear who is contributing each section of the proposal. Mention and assign that person using a Google Docs comment.

There are usually 2 types of criteria. First, a list of things that could disqualify you. Second, a list of categories where you can score points.

For the first category, make a checklist and make sure you're 100% confident in those items being checked off before you submit. For the actual scoring, it's likely the prospect has a committee reviewing scores, and likely they'll even be "blind". This means they'll be worried about being perceived as unfair, and will usually follow the criteria quite literally.

For scoring criteria that are clear, focus on creating the most truthful answer that will get the highest score. Get a "proxy" person to score you, and iterate to improve your score.

For scoring criteria that are less clear, there's going to be more subjectivity. Find out what probably matters most to your evaluators, going back to the questions you asked earlier.

### External Review Step
  * Get an external reviewer to pretend to be the buyer.
  * They must evaluate according to the official Criteria.
  * Refine before sending.

### Specific Proposal Types:

#### Bidding Against ERPs

Often, we are proposing a Django based project as a more flexible, cheaper, faster and more maintainable alternative to an ERP implementation (Enterprise Resource Planning). Here are some problems with ERPs that we solve for our clients:

  * It takes an average of 11 months after go-live for SMBs to realize benefits from an ERP [1], whereas our implementations typically realize benefits in 6 to 8 weeks due to our rapid prototyping approach in the first 2 weeks.
  * In an ERP usage survey, only 14 of 287 respondents reported realizing the benefits of "Upgrading Technology" with an ERP, and 34 of 150 respondents realized the "Growth"-related goals they had when implementing ERP. ERP were more effective at realizing "Operational Efficiency" goals, however with 103 of 122 respondents reporting success.
  * Regarding ERPs "Of those organizations that have completed implementation, less than half (45%) experienced budget overruns. However, those that did experience overruns were an average of 24% over budget. When
you’re talking about an implementation budget, 24% is a lot of money. On average, organizations
reported an expected budget of $1,007,767 and an actual budget of $1,247,859." [1]
