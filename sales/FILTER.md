# Filtering Leads

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those who believe in the same things as us. The following
set of inquiries outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1) Can we articuate one of the following together? A problem, opportunity, or vision.

2) Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a big impact?

3) Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let's prototype a relationship - we'll complete a 3 week project together with no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to pursue further work.

# Filtering Proposals

We evaluate the RFP due date for logistics.
We evaluate the contract size.
We evaluate the alignment score on a 100% scale.
  * 40 points if the proposal asks for a "web application" explicitly. 30 if it seems a web app would work.
  * -20 points for .NET, oracle, java, and most others are bad. 
  * Mention of any from: Django, Node, Postgres, Vue, React, javascript give an extra 10 points.
  * 10 points if the final result publicly browsable, for portfolio value.
  * 10 points if the RFP offers losing proposals a debrief on the scoring.
  * 10 if scoring criteria is explained in the RFP.
  * 20 points for business domain (industry). How much experience do we have in similar industries. Exact match is 20 points. (Queue, medical, seafood/marine, natural resources, )
  * 30 MVP/PoC phase is an option mid-project to get feedback from users.
  * 20 points for contract size. 0 for $10k, 5 for $20k, 10 for $50k, 15 for $100k, 20 for $200k and up, 15 for over $500k, 10 for over $1M.
  * bonus: 10 points if open source is allowed.
