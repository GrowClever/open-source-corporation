# Policy

Basic company policy goes here. Keep it short and simple.

## Work Scheduling

1. Choose core hours with at least 2h/day overlap with PST per day you work. Any deviation from your core hours should be notified in the #general slack channel.

## Co-worker Interaction

1. Always approach co-workers in a respectful and supportive manner.
