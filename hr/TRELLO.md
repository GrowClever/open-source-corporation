# Trello

We use Trello for project management, as it's simple to set up access to the appropriate boards by partners and clients. A Trello board consists of a set of Cards (tasks) in the following columns.

### Trello Board Columns

#### Deferred
this column stores requested cards that have been reviewed by the consultant but can't be worked on for some reason. Usually  the card is unclear or conflicts somehow.

#### Requests
cards the client has reqeusted that are not reviewed by the team yet. This is the starting point for anyone to add cards. We shouldn't leave cards here for long. If they're actionable, move them to Backlog. If they're not, write a comment to the client asking for more information in order to make it actionable, and leave it in the deferred column. If any additonal requirements steps such as a mockup are required, mention that in the card. Attach any additional examples and/or specifications to the card.

#### Backlog
cards that have been understood by the consultant, and could be worked on. This is the traditional Scrum backlog list, ordered by priority (highest on top)

#### Sprint (In Progress)
cards actively being worked on in the current week.

#### Done
cards that are ready to be tested by the client (and where not possible, the consultant). A test can take the form of a client approval, code review, or automated test written.

### Moving cards between columns

A diagram shows how cards can move from conception to completion [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1UkPeGGzKYWkCsZpkwWB_UJ3JjWJcoT4t8qSU8A0tsy4/edit).

### Getting everything into Trello

Clients will often email you rather than use Trello. This can be fixed by forwarding their email to the trello board. Go to their Trello board, and click settings -> email-to-board settings, and add that email address as a contact in your email. You can then forward emails directly to your trello board. However, it does make a bit of a mess since email signature images and other junk show up in the tickets, so it's nice to clean them up when you look at them in Trello.
