# Trello

We use Trello for project management, as it's simple to set up access to the appropriate boards by partners and clients. See the next section for an explanation of our Trello board conventions.

#### Trello Board Headers

  * *Defer* - this column stores requested items that have been reviewed by the consultant but can't be worked on for some reason. Usually the item is unclear or conflicts somehow.
  * *Requests* - items the client has reqeusted that are not reviewed by the team yet. This is the starting point for the consultant to add items. We shouldn't leave items here for long. If they're actionable, move them to Backlog. If they're not, write a comment to the client asking for more information in order to make it actionable, and leave it in the deferred column.
  * *Backlog* - items that have been understood by the consultant, and could be worked on. This is the traditional Scrum backlog list, ordered by priority (highest on top)
  * *Sprint (In Progress)* - items actively being worked on in the current week.
  * *Done* - items that are done and testable by the client (and where not possible, the consultant). A test can take the form of a client approval, code review, or automated test written.
