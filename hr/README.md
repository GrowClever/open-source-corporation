# Human Resources

## Hiring

  * Countable does not take into account (negatively nor positively for diversity purposes), race and gender in hiring decisions. Some logistical correlations with these attributes may be considered independently however.
  * We use this job posting. (link)

## Onboarding

  * Get a countable.ca email address.
  * Use your email address to access our [slack](http://slack.com).
  * Use our slack to say hi to the team.
  * Use the team to answer your other questions.

### Set up a Timesheet

  * Make your own copy this Google Sheet (link) and share it with only your manager.
  * Filling out your timesheet every day is required. Include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs, or concise descriptions of work done.

### Environment
  
  * Read about our standard project style and coding standards.
  * Create a new Django project using Docker and docker-compose plus PostgreSQL using these practices, and get a team member to code review it using a feature branch and pull request.
  * Get invites from your team members on Trello (link), GitHub (link) and BitBucket (link) for the projects you'll be working on.
