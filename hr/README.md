# Human Resources

The purpose of this section is to provide clear processes to minimize the administrative burden of humans that work for the Company.

## Hiring

  * Countable does not take into account (negatively nor positively for diversity purposes), race and gender in hiring decisions. Some logistical correlations with these attributes may be considered independently however.
  * Countable wants to hire people who are both technically strong and are self-motivated, creative problem solvers.
  * We use [this](./POSTING.md) job posting.
  * We try to be always hiring, and will save resources to snap up the right person if they come along at any time.
