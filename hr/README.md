# Human Resources

## Hiring

  * Countable does not take into account (negatively nor positively for diversity purposes), race and gender in hiring decisions. Some logistical correlations with these attributes may be considered independently however.
  * We use [this](./ASSOCIATE_POSTING.md) job posting.

## Onboarding

  * Get a countable.ca email address.
  * Use your email address to access our [slack](http://countable-web.slack.com).
  * Use our slack to say hi to the team.
  * Use the team to answer your other questions.

### Set up a Timesheet

  * Make your own copy this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzO2pLqXMKpUPgQOxvCdTpvrFzvizq-NOh8i7EijY7Q/edit#gid=33) (sorry this is currently not open source) and share it with only your manager.
  * Filling out your timesheet every day is required. Please include a few words of description which indicate specific things you worked on for most of that day. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. Also include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs.

### Environment
  
  * Read about our [ops](../engineering/OPERATIONS.md) and [coding standards](../engineering/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
  * Complete the [training exercises](../engineering/TRAINING.md) following these practices and get a team member to code review it using a feature branch and pull request.
  * Get invites from your team members on Trello (link), GitHub (link) and BitBucket (link) for the projects you'll be working on.

Share your username with your team members on these platforms so you can be invited into specific projects:
  * [Trello](https://trello.com/b/gycu4ydQ/opportunity-road-map)
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/countable-web)
