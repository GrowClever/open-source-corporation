# Human Resources

## Hiring

  * Countable does not take into account (negatively nor positively for diversity purposes), race and gender in hiring decisions. Some logistical correlations with these attributes may be considered independently however.
  * We use [this](./ASSOCIATE_POSTING.md) job posting.

## Onboarding

  * Get a countable.ca email address.
  * Use your email address to access our [slack](http://countable-web.slack.com).
  * Use our slack to say hi to the team.
  * Use the team to answer your other questions.

### Set up a Timesheet

  * Make your own copy this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzO2pLqXMKpUPgQOxvCdTpvrFzvizq-NOh8i7EijY7Q/edit#gid=33) (sorry this is currently not open source) and share it with only your manager.
  * Filling out your timesheet every day is required. Include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs, or concise descriptions of work done.

### Environment
  
  * Read about our [ops](../engineering/OPERATIONS.md) and [coding standards](../engineering/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
  * Complete the [training exercises](../engineering/TRAINING.md) following these practices and get a team member to code review it using a feature branch and pull request.
  * Get invites from your team members on Trello (link), GitHub (link) and BitBucket (link) for the projects you'll be working on.
