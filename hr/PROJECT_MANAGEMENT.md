# Project Management

This document summarizes project management tooling and practices at Countable to assist with onboarding.

### GIT

We follow the [git-flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) branching conventions loosely. All projects should have a master (production) branch which releases are made from, and a develop (stable) branch for developers as a foundation to build features on. Feature branches are created from develop and merged back in via pull request when ready. Here are some [examples](./GIT.md) of how we'd use GIT in different cases.

### Jira

Some clients have Jira, and we use their system in this case. If they don't have Jira, we use Trello.

### Trello

We use Trello for project management, as it allows unlimited access to boards by partners and clients, encouraging  collaboration and transparency. See [TRELLO.md](./TRELLO.md).

## Methodology

  * We use Scrum like [this](./SCRUM.md).
  * Each client should have a priority ordered backlog (either in Trello or Jira)
  * Each Tuesday at 9am we have a retrospective meeting to raise any problems for the team to address, and find ways to improve our work velocity.
