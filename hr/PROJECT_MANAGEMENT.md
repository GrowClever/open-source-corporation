# Project Management

This document summarizes project management tooling and practices at Countable to assist with onboarding.

### GIT

We follow the [git-flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) branching conventions loosely. All projects should have a master (production) branch which releases are made from, and a develop (stable) branch for developers as a foundation to build features on. Feature branches are created from develop and merged back in via pull request when ready. Here are some [examples](./GIT.md) of how we'd use GIT in different cases.

### Jira

Some clients have Jira, and we use their system in this case. If they don't have Jira, we use Trello.

### Trello

We use Trello for project management, as it allows unlimited access to boards by partners and clients, encouraging  collaboration and transparency. See [./TRELLO.md].

## Methodology

  * We use a loose agile project management methodology. This is a subset of Scrum.
  * Each client should have a priority ordered backlog (either in Trello or Jira)
  * We encourage active projects to engage in a monthly or biweekly sprint plan and retrospective. This meeting includes discussing what backlog was done, updating the order of the backlog, and raising any problems for the team to address in order to improve our work velocity.
