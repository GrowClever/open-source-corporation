# Compensation Strategy

Our approach is to pay people enough to live in reasonable comfort, typically better than local wages based on your experience level, in order to give you a chance to make a big positive impact on the team. If you do that, you've earned a large raise and will share in the benefit you create substantially. This will absolutely lead to unequal pay - if you're good you'll be paid a lot more than someone who's still learning to be productive. On the positive side, this allows us to afford to hire students who still have some basic knowledge to develop in order to be productive. I think this is great because it will attract people who propel us forward over time, and avoid accumulating people who coast. I'm much more motivated working with the former.

Not everyone will agree with this approach, so it's important we state it here so we don't have someone with different expectations join the team.

1. If necessary, the company will purchase a linux computer. The specs will be commensurate with what your manager decides you need after discussing your job. You may not all get the same specs as others at the company.
2. If you're assigned a change in compensation, that will take a effect starting in your next pay period, not immediately, nor backdated to past hours.
