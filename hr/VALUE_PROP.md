# Value Prop to Our Employees and Subcontractors

Define what we'd like to offer our employees, compared with their other options.

  * More stability than freelancing
  * More autonomy than most other jobs, once sufficiently trained.
  * Contribute to, and benefit from a system of automating away the boring parts of our work.
  * Comparatively flexible hours (versus being an employee)
  * A variety of projects.
  * A great environment for learning about web software from/with the team.
