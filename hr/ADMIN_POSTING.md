If you love helping a team stay organized, online research, and are enthusiastic about communicating with a diverse set of stakeholders, let's chat!

You will be responsible for conducting market research, usability testing, and other activities to support our team of consultants. You'll attend weekly video team Scrum meetings and talk about the details of what you did each week. For this reason, it's required that we have a single person for consistency, not a changing team.
