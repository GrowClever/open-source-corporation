# Delivery Workflow Documentation (for Clients)

## Submitting Work Requests to Countable

We use Trello to communicate work items with our clients.

1. Go to the Trello Board we've set up for you. You'll see a number of columns containing cards.
2. Create a new Card in the "Requested" column.
3. Click your card to create a description. If it's a bug, include the URL you observed it on and steps to reproduce it. If it's a feature, document the rationale.
4. Add any file attachments with any examples, templates, screenshots or other specification files.
5. If you want a specific person's attention, mention them in a comment under the card or add them as a "member". Otherwise, it may be some time before someone sees your card.

For more information on how we use Trello, see [here](./TRELLO.md).

## How We Process Your Work Request

1. New requests go into the *Requested* column and from there we triage them (confirm they're clear). If so, they're moved to "Backlog".
2. Each Monday, we move items from Backlog column into the the Sprint column (meaning it's planned for completion this week). This way we can plan our week and it's clear to clients approximately when things will be done.

Please let us know if there's an issue with how your work items are handled. If you're in a rush to get something done, let us know and we'll try to include it in the earliest possible sprint. Otherwise, we're assuming cards at the top of the Backlog column in Trello are higher priority.
