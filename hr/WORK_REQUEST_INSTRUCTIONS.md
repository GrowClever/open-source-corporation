# Submitting Work Requests to Countable

We use Trello to communicate work items with our clients.

1. Go to the Trello Board we've set up for you. You'll see a number of columns containing cards.
2. Create a new Card in the "Requested" column.
3. Click your card to create a description. If it's a bug, include the URL you observed it on and steps to reproduce it. If it's a feature, document the rationale.
4. Add an file attachments with any examples, templates, screenshots or other specification files.
5. If you want a specific person's attention, mention them in a comment under the card or add them as a "member". Otherwise, it may be some time before someone sees your card.
