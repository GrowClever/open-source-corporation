Hi!

`cta`

If you're a back end coding Guru who loves Node.JS and Linux, let's chat!

`responsibilities and skills`

Make all our user interfaces look good and be painfully easy to use :)

You will be responsible for:

1. Developering back-end features (Node.JS and/or Django) with automated tests (ie, mocha, jasmine)
2. Rest APIs, backend jobs and queues, Linux server administration, automation jobs.
3. Excellent code quality and standards.
4. Working on improving our back end work delivery pipeline by finding ways to improve and automate jobs on servers.

You should have a portfolio that demonstrates most if not all of:

1. Node.JS, experience with npm, writing tests, debugging.
2. Python (Django and Flask)
3. Linux
4. Docker
5. Postgres (SQL)

There will be a technical test on the above skills, so it will save everyone time if you're honest about your abilities.

`test`

Design a rest api for an (TBD) app.
