# Promotion Criteria

This page is intended as a guide of what we look for in selection of Junior Partners at the consultancy.
   
   * Set an example of high standards in productivity and quality of work. Seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very motivational.
   * Take ownership of our mission (always push it forward, and question/clarify it)
   * Take ownership of clients' results. Follow up on discussions in a constructive way (with respect to objectives)
   * Support your team members. Assess their work, give positive feedback where due. Provide honest negative feedback (but do so with empathy and clear examples, not generalization).
   * Steer ongoing conversations with stakeholders in a constructive way (towards our shared goals).
   * Make consistent (even if small) improvements to the systems around you. Make a PR to clarify a document or code.
   * Get very good at knowing when to escalate (ask for help) from your colleagues and client, and when to just dig deeper on your own.
