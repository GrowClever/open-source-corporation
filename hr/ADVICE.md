# Advice for Success at the Company

This page is intended as a guide of what we look for in selection of Junior Partners at the consultancy.

   * The type of leadership we're looking for has nothing to do with status, official role or really even with precedent. We've seen co-op students who are great leaders, and executives who are not.
   * Steer ongoing conversations with stakeholders in a constructive way. Demonstrate why your words matter in terms of ROI or team stress levels/happiness.
   * Lead with specific actions that demonstrate how to improve things for the team. Small things like a pull request to make something easier to understand is a great way to show you care about the project.
   * A consistent effort to do so in a way that saves everyone time and reflects the group's priorities (known or soon to be known). The process of learning the client and team's vision, understanding their problems, and translating that into technical frame is the real work that has to be done, and leadership is when someone does something to move the team towards that end.
   * Get very good at knowing when to escalate (ask for help) from your colleagues and client.
   * Work strategically to avoid technical debt.
   * Think of the Company as a machine, and how you can access levers to make it run better and produce better outcomes in our product and for our clients.
