# Advice for Success at the Company

This page is intended as a guide of what we look for in selection of Junior Partners at the consultancy.

   * Take ownership of our mission (always push it forward, and question/clarify it)
   * Take ownership of clients' results.
   * Support your team members. Assess their work, give positive feedback where due. Provide honest negative feedback when asked to provide it.
   * Steer ongoing conversations with stakeholders in a constructive way (towards our shared goals).
   * Make consistent (even if small) improvements to the systems around you. Make a PR to clarify a document or code.
   * Get very good at knowing when to escalate (ask for help) from your colleagues and client, and when to just dig deeper on your own.
