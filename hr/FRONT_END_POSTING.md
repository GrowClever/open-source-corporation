Hi!

If you love CSS and HTML (and maybe some javascript and design), let's chat!

You should have a portfolio that demonstrates most if not all of:

1. CSS and HTML
2. UI Design in Photoshop, Sketch or other tools for front end mockups.
3. javascript
4. UX / Usability testing and communication.
5. Excellent english

There will be a technical test on the above skills, so it will save everyone time if you're honest about your abilities.
