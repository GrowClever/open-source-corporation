Hi!

We are a new-ish, fast moving web agency and SaaS firm. We want you to help us envision and shape the company. Every voice matters and we want to find ways to always improve, push each other to our potential, and be the best solution for our customers. We strive to find work that excites us and ways to make our work exciting. We've open-sourced our company's operations manual here if you want to learn more about our current thinking.

You will be responsible for html/css/javascript work and design/usability based on ability, on several clients' websites and on our internal products.

We also expect you to proactively contribute to the team and company based on quarterly objectives, particularly in the branding area. This will be a fast paced job that requires juggling several responsibilities but being given the space to do great work.

Remote is ok, being within a few hours of the PST time zone is a bonus.

We are open to a variety of work arrangements and time commitments, let us know what you prefer. We'd want at least 2 days per week dedicated to our team though, and 3 or 4. Full time is ok too.

Your application must include a resume, portfolio links, and a cover letter of 200 words explaining why we may be a good fit. Convince me that you're interested in our being part of our mission (see documentation link above). If you help achieve it, there are stock and cash bonuses available.

Countable wants to hire people who are both technically strong and are self-motivated, creative problem solvers. We are looking for a someone who is very good with at least 3 of the following skill areas. You should have a portfolio that demonstrates it.

1. CSS and HTML
2. UI Design in Photoshop, Sketch or other tools for front end mockups.
3. javascript
4. UX / Usability testing and communication.
5. Excellent english

There will be a technical test on the above skills, so it will save everyone time if you're honest about your abilities. You must have reasonable written English skills at a minimum, but the better your english, the better your application will be.

I look forward to hearing from you!
