Hi!

We are a new-ish, fast moving web agency and SaaS firm. We want you to help us envision and shape the company. Every voice matters and we want to find ways to always improve, push each other to our potential, and be the best solution for our customers. We strive to find work that excites us and ways to make our work exciting. We've open-sourced our company's operations manual here if you want to learn more about our current thinking.

We also expect you to proactively contribute to the team and company based on quarterly objectives. This will be a fast paced job that requires juggling several responsibilities but being given the space to do great work.

We are open to a variety of work arrangements and time commitments, let us know what you prefer.

Your application must include a resume, and a cover letter. To avoid automated submissions, and to see if you pay attention to detail and follow instructions, your cover letter must have exactly 100 words explaining your back story, and exactly 100 words about your first impression of Countable, and a question about us. I hope you're interested in our being part of our mission (see documentation link above). If you help achieve it, there are stock and cash bonuses available.

Countable wants to hire people who are both technically strong and are self-motivated, creative problem solvers.

You must have excellent written English skills at a minimum, but the better your English, the better your application will be.

I look forward to hearing from you!
