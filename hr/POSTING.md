Hi!

`cta (call to action) here "let's chat"`

Want to be challenged by a team who will push you to your potential, and support you along the way? If so, we may be the place for you.

We are a boutique, handsome web technology consulting firm. And, we are the best show in town, when it comes to web technology, as our roster of happy clients will verify! They include the Tesla of boats, a star-trak grade medical devices startup, global comicbook brand, and a next generation of cellular data provider. We help socially responsible, driven, and lucky companies across the globe get their piece of the internet, whatever form that may take. It involves creating amazing things in an environment of your own design.

We are technology consultants and product creators who love to prototype and experiment on the web. We want you to help us envision and shape the company. Every voice matters and we want to find ways to always improve, push each other to our potential, and be the best solution for our customers. We strive to find work that excites us and ways to make our work exciting. We've open-sourced our company's operations manual here if you want to learn more about our current thinking.

We also expect you to proactively contribute to the team and company based on quarterly objectives. This will be a fast paced job that requires juggling several responsibilities but being given the space to do great work.

`responsibilities and skills`

We are open to a variety of work arrangements and time commitments, let us know what you prefer.

Countable wants to hire people who:
  * are productive and talented at technical work.
  * are self-motivated, creative problem solvers.
  * a continuous, self-motivated learner, and take initiative to improve the environment for yourself and your team members.
  * experiment with great focus, but know when to investigate a problem deeper yourself, when to ask your team for help.
  * voice disagreements rather than keeping them to yourself. We need all opinions need to be on the table if they're to be taken into account.
  * consider both the big picture and minute details, from a client's overall business down to crossing T's and dotting I's.
  * have excellent written English skills.

Your application must include a resume, and a cover letter. To avoid automated submissions, and to see if you pay attention to detail and follow instructions, your cover letter must have exactly 100 words explaining your back story, and exactly 100 words about your first impression of Countable, and a question about us. I hope you're interested in our being part of our mission (see documentation link above). If you help achieve it, there are stock and cash bonuses available.

I look forward to hearing from you!
