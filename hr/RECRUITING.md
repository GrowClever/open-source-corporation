## Recruiting Process

The goal is for us to maximize the talent of our team. Finding the best people is one of the top challenges in our industry, so we need every advantage we can find in this way. 

  * We should always have active job postings for positions as long as we'd consider the best possible applicant if they did happen to apply.
  * We should improve our company profile so the right people will apply.
  
### Point system

  * 1 point for communication ability. No point awarded if candidates who miss the cover letter formatting requirement.
  * 1 point for for writing ability. Reject if you see poor English, grammar errors, spelling mistakes in the cover letter.
  * 1 point for having 2 or more years of technical experience in all requested domains/technologies. Or, 1 year and a computer science degree (not IT diploma).
  * 1 point for a well designed/formatted resume.
  * 1 point for portfolio links. Candidate should have at least one link to good quality content they built, which looks professional (as if produced by a good quality agency, see dribbble.com, awwwards.com .
  * 1 point for any outstanding item (reviewer's discretion). This could include an open source project or contributions (many GitHub stars), going to a top school and receiving academic honours, having worked at Google, etc.
  
Candidates with less than 4 points are rejected outright. Those with 4 points other than "communication ability" can be offered a chance to re-read the application and format it correctly, answering the hidden question. This is required for them to advance.

Now, answer their questions about the company. Candidates with 4 or 5 stars may now take the technical screening.
