As an open transparent company, we want to minimize the number of assets which need protection. Here's a list of those we can't make excpetions for:

  * Any real financial numbers.
  * Any client's database (particularly their customer data).
  * Any client's intellectual property which is not already open source.

Other associated risks:

  * Availability - minimize any downtime of client web properties.
  * Durability - avoid losing any data stored in clients' databases or image assets.
