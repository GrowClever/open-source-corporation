# Look at your Job Options, Now Back to Me

You're just finishing your bachelor's of computer science. You can code pretty well. Pretty darn well, and too well to be a low level cog in the corporate machine? What to be challenged by a team who will push you to your potential, and support you along the way? If so, we may be the place for you.

We are a boutique, handsome web technology consulting firm. And, we are the best show in town, when it comes to web technology, as our roster of happy clients will verify! They include the Tesla of boats, a star-trak grade medical devices startup, global comicbook brand, and a next generation of cellular data provider. We help socially responsible, driven, and lucky companies across the globe get their piece of the internet, whatever form that may take. It involves writing awesome code, in an environment of your own design.
  * We welcome you to work from home, or rent a desk at the local colo, up to you.
  * We want you to decide your own hours and working style.
  * We will challenge you to build awesome stuff and learn from the best.

While not a holocracy, we minimize politics and other trappings of your average coding job. We're transparent and principled, and everyone's opinion counts. We believe the best performance comes from letting people find their own solutions within a framework. It's all about executing projects you care about. The downside is fighting off those pesky Google recruiters once they get a look at your portfolio...
Our tech stack includes:
  * Linux
  * Postgres
  * Docker
  * Node.JS
  * Python
  * HTML
  * CSS

Knowing a frontend JS framework is a plus (ie: Riot, Vue, React, Angular, jQuery in that order)
We love to use open source and contribute back to the community where possible.
We expect you to:
  * Be a continuous, self-motivated learner, and take initiative to improve the environment for yourself and your team members.
  * Experiment with great focus, but know when to investigate a problem deeper yourself, when to ask your team for help.
  * Voice disagreements rather than keeping them to yourself. We need all opinions need to be on the table if they're to be taken into account.
  * Consider both the big picture and minute details, from a client's overall business down to individual lines of code.
  * Know how to code, and there will be a technical test.

This message is specifically written for UBC and SFU Computer Science grads of 2017 but exceptions could be made, especially if you do wear Old Spice deodorant. If you're interested, fire us a link to something you've worked on, and a little about yourself.
I'm on a horse, expecting your emails so open up your SMTP clients and say `HELO`.
