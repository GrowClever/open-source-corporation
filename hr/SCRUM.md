# Scrum

Countable's now using [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage client work and internal projects.

We have a 1 week sprint:
  * Monday - For individual projects, do your sprint planning (move cards from the top of Backlog to your Sprint of work for the week)
  * Tuesday - 9am is a team-wide meeting for our sprint retrospective for all projects, and sprint planning for internal projects (Systems). After the meeting, archive your Done columns in kanban boards so you can see just the currrent week's progress.
  * Friday - A weekly email regarding any special or ongoing items and reminders for the next week's meeting agenda.
  * Every weekday - as you complete cards, move them to the Done column.

We do not have daily stand up meetings, although 3 or more of us are collaborating on one thing, we may temporarily form a daily stand up meeting for that project.

For a visual aid of how our work is processed, see this [Business Process Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1UkPeGGzKYWkCsZpkwWB_UJ3JjWJcoT4t8qSU8A0tsy4/edit).
