# TRANSPARENCY

There are data indicating transparency is important:
"90% of job seekers say that it's important to work for a company that embraces transparency." (Glassdoor U.S. Site Survey, January 2016; *Updated from 96%, Glassdoor survey, October 2014).

Other reasons:
  1. To avoid secrets. Unnecesary secrets have a cost to the organization because everyone must focus on managing information access rather than other business activities (which create net value unlike hiding information).
  2. Trust. Between any parties working with or within the Company.
  3. Alignment and Clarity. We will be incentivized to design processes which benefit everyone. And failing this, at least expectations will be laid out.
  4. Learning. To help us learn from others, and others to learn from us.
  5. Experimentation. An experiment on practical corporate transparency limits.

Caveats:
  1. As mentioned elsewhere, the need to be clear about what information is Confidential and careful it's not released along with everything else.
  2. The cost of publishing everything on public channels. This should be mitigated by automating by convention an tools.
  3. The cost of ensuring what's released is clear and interpreted how intended.
