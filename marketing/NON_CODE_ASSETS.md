## Google Drive

Every client has a folder in our Company Google Drive named:

/clients/<client name>/

### Sharing

For each client, this folder (and all its' contents) is shared with the following people and no others.

  * The client's designated staff who we are working with, and showing our work to.
  * Our staff who perform work for that client.
  
  
### Structure

  * /clients/<client name>/Mockups should contain all drafts and revisions of mockups for clients to approve and developers to work from. Make it obvious which is the latest one, by deleting old ones when a new one comes available.
  * /clients/<client name>/Assets should container all sliced imaages and other raw assets for developers to include in their code projects.
