# Creative Brief

(This is a draft, and may change substantially)

This document outlines our rationale for, and approach to visual design for the Countable brand.

## Rationale

Visual design is a communication tool for meeting the right kinds of clients and subcontractors.

### Goal

To have the strongest web presence and best branding in our class (full service web firms)

### Offering

We prototype custom software using web technology to understand domain problems more deeply and demonstrate ROI early on.

### Audience

Audience #1a - Small businesses (but, bigger ones) or SMEs, typically who have no in-house developer team, or an incomplete one that lacks some web tech areas. These businesses will typically be 10 to 500 employees. Businesses may have developer teams but want an outside perspective or skill supplement.  The typical decider is the owner or another executive at one of these businesses. They'll likely be someone very immersed in their industry, and use the web for reading trade publications and business publications primarily. Persona: Barrett runs a private firm that developed a disruptive hardware component but doesn't have web UI, apps or cloud integration.

Audience #1b - Also, funded startups that needs capacity for a one-off need such as a prototype. Persona: Tifa has raised seed funding and needs a prototype for market research, further momentum with funders.

Audience #2 - Developers and creatives like us. We want to attract the best talent by showcasing a interesting place to work. Persona: Aeris wants a job that is challenging with lots of autonomy to hone her skills alongside ambitious and skilled peers.

Audience #3 - Recruiters, who are usually pitching to group 1. The recruiter's intent is to pitch strong resources for the businesses, so the design approach should still be mostly geared towards the business itself. Persona: Sephiroth would like the option to provide a team solution rather than just individual candidates when a fitting situation arises with his clients.

### Competition

Several other categories compete with us, including hiring in-house, freelancers, placement firms and agencies. Of these, we most directly compete with agencies who do end-to-end web based software development work.

### Message

We'll take the time to understand your business and help you craft the right technology strategy for your needs. Then, we have the capacity necessary to understand all the nuts and bolts for implementation.

## Design Principles

1. All design elements should be intentional and have an explainable purpose. Less elements emphasizes the best ones. Don't try to be clever or subtle. This symbolizes how we value clarity and simplicity.
2. The design should be functional, and facilitate the intended usage.
3. The design need not always follow design trends but should at least indicate we are aware of them. Cherry pick some trends that work.
4. Advanced technical elements (3d, parralax, etc ) are good because they showcase out technical work but should not be used at the expense of being simple.
5. Don't try to be clever or subtle, it goes against our desire for clarity.
