# Creative Brief

(This is a draft, and may change substantially)

This document outlines our rationale for, and approach to visual design for the Countable brand.

## Rationale

Visual design is a communication tool for meeting the right kinds of clients and subcontractors.

### Goal

To have the strongest web presence and best branding in our class (full service web firms)

### Audience

Audience #1 - Small businesses (but, bigger ones) or SMEs, typically who have no in-house developer team, or small/incomplete one. Also, funded startups that needs capacity for a one-off need such as a prototype. Businesses who have developer teams but want an outside perspective or skill supplement. These businesses will typically be 10 to 500 employees. The typical decider is the owner or another executive at one of these businesses. They'll likely be someone very immersed in their industry, and use the web for reading trade publications and business publications primarily.

Audience #2 - developers and creatives like us. We want to attract the best talent by showcasing a interesting place to work.

### Competition

Several other categories compete with us, including hiring in-house, freelancers, placement firms and agencies. Of these, we most directly compete with agencies who do end-to-end web based software development work.

  * Pre-packaged best practices for avoiding technical debt, helping with succession, scalability and numerous other architecture and people problems.
  * A bias towards putting the client's needs first in the interest of fostering long term relationships.
  * We've spent resources dealing with all the overhead of a technical project in advance, and can collaborate with you to create customer value immediately.
  * Expertise in prototyping quickly to test ideas and market response.

  * Adaptability.

### Message

We'll take the time to understand your business and help you craft the right technology strategy for your needs. Then, we have the capacity necessary to understand all the nuts and bolts for implementation.

## Design Principles

1. All design elements should be intentional and have an explainable purpose. Less elements emphasizes the best ones. Don't try to be clever or subtle. This symbolizes how we value clarity and simplicity.
2. The design should be functional, and facilitate the intended usage.
3. The design need not always follow design trends but should at least indicate we are aware of them. Cherry pick some trends that work.
4. Advanced technical elements (3d, parralax, etc ) are good because they showcase out technical work but should not be used at the expense of being simple.
5. Don't try to be clever or subtle, it goes against our desire for clarity.
