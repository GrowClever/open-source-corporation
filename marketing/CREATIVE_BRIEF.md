## Design Principles

1. All design elements should be intentional and have an explainable purpose. Less elements emphasizes the best ones. Don't try to be clever or subtle. This symbolizes how we value clarity and simplicity.
2. The design should be functional, and facilitate the intended usage.
3. The design need not always follow design trends but should at least indicate we are aware of them. Cherry pick some trends that work.
4. Advanced technical elements (3d, parralax, etc ) are good because they showcase out technical work but should not be used at the expense of being simple.
5. Don't try to be clever or subtle, it goes against our desire for clarity.
