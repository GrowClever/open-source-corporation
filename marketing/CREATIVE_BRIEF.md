# Creative Brief

(This is a draft, and may change substantially)

This document outlines our rationale for, and approach to visual design for the Countable brand.

## Rationale

Visual design is a communication tool for meeting the right kinds of clients and subcontractors.

### Goal

To connect with people who will go the distance to make a big postive impact on the world.

### Offering

We rapidly prototype custom software using web technology to understand domain problems more deeply and demonstrate value early on.

### Audience

#### Clients

  * We are segmenting (filtering for) people and businesses who identify as startups but often exist in other organization structures. People who want to try something new and affect change using the web.
  * Typically, small enterprises (50 to 500 employees) often with some technical acumen (3 to 5 out of 10), no in-house developer team, or an incomplete one that lacks some web tech areas.
  * The typical decider is the owner or tech lead of the business. *Persona: Barrett runs a private firm that developed a disruptive hardware component but doesn't have web UI, apps or cloud integration.*
  * Another example is a funded startup that needs a world class web technology component such as a dashboard, customer interface or API. *Persona: Tifa has raised seed funding and needs a prototype for market research, further momentum with funders.*
  * Their web app will touch many people. We'd rather build things that are publicly used by millions, because these tend to have higher impact (all other things equal), and create more visibility for us.

#### Staff

We want to attract ambitious, talented people who are good communicators. *Persona: Aeris wants a job that is challenging with lots of autonomy to hone her skills alongside ambitious and skilled peers.*

#### Segmentation

Given our experience range is so broad, it's hard to segment by industry. Instead, we segment by ambition. Our value prop "Look at this wide range of great projects we've done: We can do anything on the web. If you have a moonshot idea, want to go beyond the status quo in our business where no one else has before, do you don't want someone who specializes in your industry's status quo as they'll deliver just that. We've demonstrated the ability to create next-level web technology that disrupts your competitors and breaks your industry's mold. We create leaders on the web."

### Competition

Several other categories compete with us, including hiring in-house, freelancers, placement firms and agencies. Of these, we most directly compete with agencies who do end-to-end web based software development work.

  * Pre-packaged best practices for avoiding technical debt, helping with succession, scalability, operations.
  * A focus on big, long term ROI on our billables.
  * Focus on our versatility, and successes in many different industries.

### Tone

  * Clarity and simplicity.
  * Adaptability.

## Design Principles

1. All design elements should be intentional and have an explainable purpose. Less elements emphasizes the best ones. Don't try to be clever or subtle. This symbolizes how we value clarity and simplicity.
2. The design should be functional, and facilitate the intended usage.
3. The design need not always follow design trends but should at least indicate we are aware of them. Cherry pick some trends that work.
4. Advanced technical elements (3d, parralax, etc ) are good because they showcase out technical work but should not be used at the expense of being simple.
5. Don't try to be clever or subtle, it goes against our desire for clarity.
