This document outlines our rationale for, and approach to visual design for the Countable brand.

## Intro

Countable wants to solve the problem of building a great web technology integration pipeline for your product. Your product needs web applications, APIs, mobile apps, web based automation and operations UI, and the list goes on. Web technology has played a huge underlying role in nearly all facets of an organization's technology so having a great web technologist team is a key competitive advantage. But finding the right people, developing the best practices and processes, researching platforms, integrating with business strategy. The competition for this expertise is enormous, and then you have to retain them with they get emails from recruiters every day. We provide a better option. Get just as much access to experienced web team as you need, with no need to ramp up. If you want, you get open access to all our processes to build your own capacity in parallel and help them become world class. Let us make your web technology excellent!

## Rationale

Visual design is a communication tool for meeting the right kinds of clients and subcontractors.

### Audience

Medium sized businesses, typically who have no in-house developer team, or small/incomplete one. Also, any business that needs capacity for a one-off need such as a special prototype / project. Businesses who have developer teams but want an outside perspective or skill supplement.

### Competition

Several other categories compete with us, including hiring in-house, freelancers, placement firms and agencies. Of these, we most directly compete with agencies who do end-to-end web based software development work.

In search (SEO) at least, we compete for the terms "Web Application Firm" and "Web Software Firm" with:

## Design Principles

1. All design elements should be intentional and have an explainable purpose. Less elements emphasizes the best ones. Don't try to be clever or subtle. This symbolizes how we value clarity and simplicity.
2. The design should be functional, and facilitate the intended usage.
3. The design need not always follow design trends but should at least indicate we are aware of them. Cherry pick some trends that work.
4. Advanced technical elements (3d, parralax, etc ) are good because they showcase out technical work but should not be used at the expense of being simple.
5. Don't try to be clever or subtle, it goes against our desire for clarity.
