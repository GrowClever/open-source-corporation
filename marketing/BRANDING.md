# Branding Projects


## Process

1. Brand development questionnaire
1. Discovery meeting (review other work, discuss answers to questionnaire)
1. Propose sketches and color paletttes

## Guidelines

How can we get more buy-in, commitment, alignment and clarity earlier.
  * Validate the direction by reviewing other work together.
  * Inspiration board.

Demonstrating reasearch, expertise and intention in designs.
  * Provide about 3, no more than 5. "I've narrowed dozens of sketches down to the best 3. This is why I recommend these directions to your audience..."
  * Explain how the proposed designs capture their desired brand requirements, and appeal to the audience.
