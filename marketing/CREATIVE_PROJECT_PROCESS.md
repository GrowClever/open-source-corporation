# Creative Project Process

1. Do a "creative brief". For small projects that don't merit a full one, ask the client what the goal of the work is (a mini creative brief... who's it for, and what do we want them to get from it). This goes beyond helping get the right design. It helps generates rapport and a useful conversation with the client and indicates you care about their results.
2. As a designer, you are the most important gatekeeper of visual appeal and user experience. It's better to err towards being a perfectionist here. It's your job to do so, and clients/colleagues understand that. Ask for better input assets if needed, and indicate any design problems (regardless of the cause). Take ownership of the quality control process.
3. When defining a project, determine any hard deadlines like printing and distribution. Plan to provide a "final" draft 24h before this date. Implies we should have a version 48h in advance that is the last chance for client to give feedback. The goal is no changes are needed to this draft, but if so, we have a buffer.
4. For new work that has complex information, start with a wireframe. It's important to do a wireframe because the medium shows that you're still in a conceptual phase, getting agreement on the basic structure.
5. Then do a simple visual mockup, with a few variants if possible to compare various good ideas. Discuss examples of other work you like, and cherry pick elements for inspiration.
