# New Creative Project Process

  * Do a "creative brief". For small projecst that don't merit a full one, ask the cilent what the goal of the work is (a mini creative brief... who's it for, and what do we want them to get from it). This goes beyond helping get the right design. It helps generates rapport and a useful conversation with the client and indicates you care about their results.
  * As a designer, you are the most important gatekeeper of visual appeal and user experience. It's better to err towards being a perfectionist here. It's your job to do so, and clients/colleagues understand that. Ask for better input assets if needed, and indicate any design problems (regardless of the cause). Take ownership of the quality control process.
  * For new work that has complex information, start with a wireframe.
  * Then do a simple visual mockup, with a few variants if possible to compare various good ideas.
