Overarching mission: _Make It Easier and More Fun To Create Things On The Internet_

Examples of how we embody this missing.

  * _Help our Clients Get Faster Results on the Web_ - With faster feedback loops via prototyping, Scrum and tools which improve transparency.
  * _A widget in every website_: Website Owners should be able to install and manage their website from a single place, instead of having to find and manage many 3rd party component management dashboards.
  * _Create Better Customer Service Systems_ - Reduce queue lengths, and improve customer experiences using web technology.

The purpose statement also says a lot by what's left out. It helps us work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and colleagues decide if we're a good fit. We should refer to this mission to justify our projects and other pages of this manual. The mission should be reviewed quarterly.
