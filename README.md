# open-source-corporation
I'm open sourcing my corporation (what that means will become more clear as time goes on). To start with, articles of incorporation, and templates for legal, accounting will be published here.

## Background
This repo contains much of the paperwork associated with Countable Web Productions Inc, a boutique consulting firm and small business which sells saas products and advertising space.

## Purpose
  * To share experiences in managing a small corporation with others, and maybe save someone's time.
  * As an experiment in corporate document management.
  * To explore practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * The Articles of Incorporation.
  * Document templates used by the company, including guides, accounting and legal docs.
  * Document templates for specific divisions of the business. In our case, the division is made by revenue stream, but this could be done by other dimensions such as team specialty.
  * Some subset of these documents may be useful for small consulting firms, sole proprietorships, non-profits, and/or startup teams. This is likely to be less true for medium to large organizations of any kind.
  * _out of scope- : At this time, filled financial statements, timesheets, invoices and other documents with monetary specifics are kept private (only templates for them are stored here). In the (medium to long term) future, this may change.

## Conventions
  * All documents begin with a 'purpose' and 'scope', concisely indicating what the document is used for, and what it does and doesn't contain.
  * All documents are written in Markdown, for easy of use via SCM (GIT) oriented platforms such as GitHub.

## Contributing
