## An Experiment in Transparency

This is an experiment to "open source" [Countable Web Productions Inc.](http://countable.ca). Like a software project, our items analogous to "code" such as written templates and processes are publicly available for anyone to use under the MIT license. Just as an open source software project does not disclose its database contents, this repo does not include any of our clients and employees private data. Countable is a boutique consulting firm and small business which also sells SaaS products and advertising space.

## Purpose
The intention of this project is to maximize transparency at Countable while it is small. If we grow, it may be more difficult to introduce a culture of transparency at a later stage. This assumes a hypotheses about building transparency into our company:
  1. To avoid secrets. Secrets have a cost to the organization because everyone must focus on managing information access rather than other business activities (which create net value unlike hiding information).
  2. To create trust. Secrets create stress, create mistrust, and consume energy to store.
  3. To create alignment. Transparency will drive the business to follow processes which are aligned with the interests of our stakeholders and the public.
  4. To help us learn from others, and others to learn from us.
  5. To satisfy my curiousity on practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * The Articles of Incorporation.
  * Document templates used by the company, including guides, accounting and legal docs.
  * Document templates for specific divisions of the business. In our case, the division is made by revenue stream, but this could be done by other dimensions such as team specialty.
  * Countable is a [CCPC](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it458r2/it458r2-e.html), but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other structures like an LLC, C-Corp, sole proprietorship, non-profit, and/or startup teams. This is likely to be less true for medium to large organizations of any kind.
  * We will not publish information here that would compromise the privacy or property of our employees, clients or customers. We will not do so without explicitly documented intent to do so by the affected party. For example, _filled_ timesheets, invoices and other documents with monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For these, only templates will be provided.
