# open-source-corporation
I'm open sourcing my corporation (what that means will become more clear as time goes on).

## Purpose
  * To share experiences in managing a small corporation with others and save them time.
  * As an experiment in corporate document template management.
  * To explore practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * Document templates I use in my company, including guides, accounting and legal docs.
  * Document templates for specific divisions of the business. In our case, the division is made by revenue stream, but this could be done by other dimensions such as team specialty.
