# open-source-corporation
I'm open sourcing my corporation (what that means will become more clear as time goes on).

## Purpose
  * To share experiences in managing a small corporation with others and save them time.
  * As an experiment in corporate document template management.
  * To explore practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * Document templates I use in my company, including guides, accounting and legal docs.
  * Document templates for specific divisions of the business. In our case, the division is made by revenue stream, but this could be done by other dimensions such as team specialty.
  * Some subset of these documents may be useful for small consulting firms, sole proprietorships, non-profits, and/or startup teams. This is likely to be less true for medium to large organizations of any kind.

## Conventions
  * All documents begin with a 'purpose' and 'scope', concisely indicating what the document is used for, and what it does and doesn't contain.
  * All documents are written in Markdown, for easy of use via SCM (GIT) oriented platforms such as GitHub.

## Contributing
Yes, please!
