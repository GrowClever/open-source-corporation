# Countable Web Productions Inc Operations Manual

## What Is This?

This is an experiment to "open source" the [Countable Web Productions Inc.](http://countable.ca) *operations manual*. Like a software project, our processes and other information assets are publicly available for anyone to use under the MIT license. *However*, just as an open source software project does not disclose its database contents, this repository does not include any of our clients' and employees' private data.

## Who Started This?
Countable is a web tech consulting firm which also sells SaaS products and advertising space. For more info see our:

  * [Founder's vision](./VISION.md) - This is a very rough draft and subject to a lot of changes.
  * [Mission](./MISSION.md) - Countable exists to make these happen.

## Purpose

*First, why does this repository exist?* The purpose of this repository is to document Countable's operations for convenient reference, discussion and amendment.

*Second, why is it open source?* To promote [transparency](./TRANSPARENCY.md).

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * Business process digrams and definitions.
  * The Articles of Incorporation and other general corporate documents. Countable is a [CCPC](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it458r2/it458r2-e.html), but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other organization structures.
  * Document templates used by the company for accounting and legal.
  * We will not publish information here that would compromise the privacy or property of our employees, clients or customers. For example, _filled_ timesheets, invoices and other documents with monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For these, only empty templates will be provided.

## Contributing
If you want to suggest a change to Countable Web Productions, make a pull request. The rules:
   * *Important: Never commit private data or protected intellectual property. Nothing specific to our employees, clients, or finances should go in here.*
   * Link prolifically. Wherever you can, link words of your pages to other pages or other websites.
   * Keep it concise, to-the-point, actionable. If you do use an abstraction, provide a corresponding example.
   * Each page should state it's purpose for existing, as related to the company's [mission](./MISSION.md). Clarity and utility over completeness. Try to maximize "usefulness density", or the total benefit (ie, in saved time, dollars) of the content divided by its length (in characters).
   * This repository is intended for a specific company (Countable Web Productions Inc.), if you want to use it for another company, please fork it.

### Processes

Processes are sequences of steps (like algorithms). Details on defining them [here](./PROCESSES.md).

### Templates

Templates are simply empty documents with no data specific to any Employee or Client, and no real financial data. Templates should be markdown, or public [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JfcXagifO5wmixA-vjI_qgYs1qzw4-dM) charts or sheets.

### Memos

Memos are unstructured notes that tell the story of what we're trying to do and propose principles supporting those objectives. This is a catch-all for documents which are neither processes nor templates.
