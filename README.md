## An Experiment in Transparency
This is an experiment to "open source" [Countable Web Productions Inc.](http://countable.ca). Like a software project, our processes and other information assets, are publicly available for anyone to use under the MIT license. *However*, just as an open source software project does not disclose its database contents, this repository does not include any of our clients and employees private data.

## Who Started This?
Countable is a boutique consulting firm and small business which also sells SaaS products and advertising space.

## Purpose
Maximize transparency the Company while it is small.
  1. Counter Secrecy. Secrets have a cost to the organization because everyone must focus on managing information access rather than other business activities (which create net value unlike hiding information).
  2. Trust. Between any parties working with or within the Company.
  3. Alignment and Clarity. We will be incentivized to design processes which benefit everyone. And failing this, at least expectations will be laid out.
  4. Learning. To help us learn from others, and others to learn from us.
  5. Experimentation. An experiment on practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * Business process digrams and definitions.
  * The Articles of Incorporation and other general corporate documents. Countable is a [CCPC](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it458r2/it458r2-e.html), but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other organization structures.
  * Document templates used by the company for accounting and legal.
  * We will not publish information here that would compromise the privacy or property of our employees, clients or customers. For example, _filled_ timesheets, invoices and other documents with monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For these, only empty templates will be provided.
