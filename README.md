# open-source-corporation
I'm open sourcing my corporation (what that means will become more clear as time goes on). This repo contains much of the paperwork associated with [Countable Web Productions Inc.](http://countable.ca), a boutique consulting firm and small business which sells saas products and advertising space. To start with, articles of incorporation, and templates for legal, accounting will be published here.

## Business by Sunlight
The intention of this project is to maximize transparency at Countable while it is small. If we grow, it may be more difficult to introduce a culture of transparency at a later stage. This assumes a hypotheses about building transparency into our company:
  1. Secrets have a cost to the organization because everyone must focus on managing information access rather than other, business activities which create value.
  2. Transparency creates trust. Secrets create stress, create mistrust, and consume energy to store.
  3. Transparency will drive the business to follow processes which are aligned with the interests of our stakeholders and the public.

## Purpose
  * To share experiences in managing a small corporation with others, and maybe save someone's time.
  * As an experiment in corporate document management.
  * To explore practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * The Articles of Incorporation.
  * Document templates used by the company, including guides, accounting and legal docs.
  * Document templates for specific divisions of the business. In our case, the division is made by revenue stream, but this could be done by other dimensions such as team specialty.
  * Countable is a [CCPC](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it458r2/it458r2-e.html), but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other structures like an LLC, C-Corp, sole proprietorship, non-profit, and/or startup teams. This is likely to be less true for medium to large organizations of any kind.
  * We will not publish information here that would compromise the privacy of our employees, clients or customers. We will not do so without explicitly documented intent to do so by the affected party. For example, _filled_ timesheets, invoices and other documents with monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For these, only templates will be provided.

## Conventions
  * All documents begin with a 'purpose' and 'scope', concisely indicating what the document is used for, and what it does and doesn't contain.
  * All documents are written in Markdown, for easy of use via SCM (GIT) oriented platforms such as GitHub.
