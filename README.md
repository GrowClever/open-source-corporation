## Pushing The Boundaries of Transparency
This is an experiment to "open source" [Countable Web Productions Inc.](http://countable.ca) as much as possible. This includes our *operations manual* and several other assets. Like a software project, our processes and other information assets, are publicly available for anyone to use under the MIT license. *However*, just as an open source software project does not disclose its database contents, this repository does not include any of our clients' and employees' private data.

## Who Started This?
Countable is a boutique consulting firm which also sells SaaS products and advertising space. For more info see our:

  * [Founder's vision](./VISION.md)
  * [Mission](./MISSION.md)

## Purpose

There are data indicating transparency is important:
"90% of job seekers say that it's important to work for a company that embraces transparency." (Glassdoor U.S. Site Survey, January 2016; *Updated from 96%, Glassdoor survey, October 2014).

What if a company took these really, really seriously from the ground up?

Maximize transparency at the Company while it is small.
  1. Counter Secrecy. Unnecesary secrets have a cost to the organization because everyone must focus on managing information access rather than other business activities (which create net value unlike hiding information).
  2. Trust. Between any parties working with or within the Company.
  3. Alignment and Clarity. We will be incentivized to design processes which benefit everyone. And failing this, at least expectations will be laid out.
  4. Learning. To help us learn from others, and others to learn from us.
  5. Experimentation. An experiment on practical corporate transparency limits.

## Scope
This repo will contain:
  * Business process digrams and definitions.
  * The Articles of Incorporation and other general corporate documents. Countable is a [CCPC](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tp/it458r2/it458r2-e.html), but it's possible some of these documents may be useful for other organization structures.
  * Document templates used by the company for accounting and legal.
  * We will not publish information here that would compromise the privacy or property of our employees, clients or customers. For example, _filled_ timesheets, invoices and other documents with monetary specifics of other parties will not be filed here. For these, only empty templates will be provided.

## Contributing
If you want to suggest a change to Countable Web Productions, make a pull request. The rules:
   * *Important: Never commit private data or protected intellectual property. Nothing specific to our employees, clients, or finances should go in here.*
   * Link prolifically. Wherever you can, link words of your pages to other pages or other websites.
   * Keep it concise, to-the-point, actionable. If you do use an abstraction, provide a corresponding example.
   * Each page should state it's purpose for existing, as related to the company's [mission](./MISSION.md). Clarity and utility over completeness. Try to maximize "usefulness density", or the total benefit (ie, in saved time, dollars) of the content divided by its length (in characters).
   * This repository is intended for a specific company (Countable Web Productions Inc.), if you want to use it for another company, please fork it.

### Processes

Processes are sequences of steps (like algorithms). Details on defining them [here](./PROCESSES.md).

### Templates

Templates are simply empty documents with no data specific to any Employee or Client, and no real financial data. Templates should be markdown, or public [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JfcXagifO5wmixA-vjI_qgYs1qzw4-dM) charts or sheets.

### Memos

Memos are unstructured notes that tell the story of what we're trying to do and propose principles supporting those objectives. This is a catch-all for documents which are neither processes nor templates. 

## Similar Efforts

  * Some companies open source aspects such as coding standards, ie [Caktus](https://github.com/caktus/developer-documentation)
  * TODO: Find more examples.
