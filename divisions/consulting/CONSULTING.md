# Consulting

## Purpose

This document is intended as an entrypoint to documentation on the consulting division.

## Scope

This document contains the consulting guidelines at Countable Web Productions.

### Project Management

We use Trello because:
  * it allows collaboration with clients on assignments.
  * is simple enough for people to join ad-hoc without training.

### Billing
  * Clients are billed monthly based on consultant timesheets.
  * Any technical work done for a client is rounded up to the nearest hour. This is intended as a reasonable incentive for clients to help reduce context switching costs.

### Methodology
  * Understand the client's business.
  * Nurture a clear domain language and use it in software development.
  * Nurture a relationship of collaboration.
  * Use agile methodology as a toolkit, where applicable.
  * Build systems which avoid recurring maintenance. It's best to work ourselves out of a job.
  * Identify big opportunities for wealth creation made possible by the client collaboration.
