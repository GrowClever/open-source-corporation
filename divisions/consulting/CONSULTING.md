# Consulting

## Purpose

This document is intended as an entrypoint to documentation on the consulting division.

## Scope

This document contains the consulting guidelines at Countable Web Productions.

### Project Management

We use Trello because:
  * it allows collaboration with clients on assignments.
  * is simple enough for people to join ad-hoc without training.

### Billing
  * Clients are billed monthly based on consultant timesheets.
  * Any technical work done for a client is rounded up to the nearest hour. This is intended as a reasonable incentive for clients to help reduce context switching costs.
