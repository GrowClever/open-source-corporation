## Law Firm Model
There already exists a consulting-based type of business where expertise is parcelled out to clients - the Law Firm. We will model after this structure. The company is organized into Senior Partners, Junior Partners and Associates. Another element we steal from Law practice is that billing is time-unit based by default.

It's not perfect, and these are seen as the Pros and Cons:

### Pros
  * Partnership structure offers a great sense of ownership and accountability.
  * Time unit billing is very simple. Commission payment is simple. So, energy is not wasted on this.
