## Law Firm Model
There already exists a consulting-based type of business where expertise is parcelled out to clients - the Law Firm. We will model after this structure. The company is organized into Senior Partners, Junior Partners and Associates. Another element we steal from Law practice is that billing is time-unit based by default.

It's not perfect, and these are seen as the Pros and Cons:

### Pros
  * Partnership structure offers a sense of ownership and accountability.
  * Time unit billing is very simple. Commission payment is simple. So, energy is not wasted on this.

### Cons
  * Value based billing has better incentive alignment with clients (so should be introduced where possible).

## Roles

### Associate

  * Paid an hourly rate, as a subcontractor.
  * Excellent performance for 6 months may lead to a Jr Partnership offer.
  * Work is assigned and checked by a Jr Partner.

### Jr Partner

  * Expected to be the expert on at least on topic for the consultancy, and be aware of current literature there.
  * Is the primary contact for one or more client relationships.
  * Takes responsibility for their clients, including planning work by other associates and partners.
  * Paid a percentage rate of billables, minus company consultancy overhead and referral payout.
  * Paid when billables are received, since they are responsible for collecting from clients. In the event of a default, the consultancy may pay up to 50% to the Partner.

Partners are expected to contribute some of the following, some of the time. The approximate commitment is a few hours per month. Beyond this a nominal stipend may be assigned when an initiative is approved in one of these areas.
  * Bring new business into the company (earning the referral commission as well on that business).
  * Exhibit leadership on the consultancy's direction, bringing up recommendations.
  * Improve the consultancy's processeses.
  * Improve the consultancy's marketing.

### Sr Partner

  * Owns at least a 5% share in the consultancy.
  * Deals with selection of Jr Partners.
  * Deals with escalation of issues in projects managed by Jr Partners.
  * Will normally be appointed to the board of directors based on this share of voting rights.
