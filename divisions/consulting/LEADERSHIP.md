# A Definition of Leadership for Technology Consultants

## Purpose

This page is intended as a guide of what we look for in selection of Junior Partners at the consultancy.

## Scope

Lists behaviour and results expected of an excellent Junior Partner candidate.

## Leadership

   * The type of leadership we're looking for has nothing to do with status, official role or really even with precedent.
   * We've seen co-op students who are great leaders, and executives who are not.
   * Lead an ongoing conversation that matters to stakeholders in a constructive way, showing them why it matters. Demonstrate the connection with ROI or team stress levels/happiness.
   * Lead with specific actions that demonstrate how to improve things for the team. Small things like a pull request to make something easier to understand is a great way to show you care about the project.
   * In the position of a developer, there are many ways to approach your job, and a consistent effort to do so in a way that saves everyone time and reflects the group's priorities (known or soon to be known), is what I consider to be meaningful leadership. The process of learning the client and team's vision, understanding their problems, and translating that into technical frame is the real work that has to be done, and leadership is when someone does something to move the team towards that end. Helping the group understand what they really want and need, anticipating roadblocks, and generally helping everyone move towards those goals.
  * Example - One thing all our projects should care about is codebase quality and avoiding technical debt. It's a difficult priority to hold onto amidst everything else and has taken me a decade to fully appreciate. It's pretty easy to keep the codebase nice when you're the only one working on it for a short time, comparatively. But when other devs jump in, or you have to bend it to an unanticipated requirement that's when technical debt is much harder to avoid and you need every advantage and tool available to mitigate it.
