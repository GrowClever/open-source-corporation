## Trello

We use Trello for project management, as it allows unlimited access to boards by partners and clients, encouraging more collaboration and transparency.

### Standard Board Headers

  * *Defer* - this column stores requested items that have been reviewed by the consultant but can't be worked on for some reason. Usually the item is unclear or conflicts somehow.
  * *Requests* - items the client has reqeusted that are not reviewed by the team yet. This is the starting point for the consultant to add items.
  * *Story* - items that have been understood by the consultant, and could be worked on. This is the traditional Scrum backlog list, ordered by priority.
  * *Sprint* - items actively being worked on in the current week.
  * *Testing* - items that are done and testable by the client (and where not possible, the consultant). A test can take the form of a client approval, code review, or automated test written.
  * *Done* - items that are tested in one of the ways mentioned under Testing.
