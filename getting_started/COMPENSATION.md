# Compensation Strategy

Not everyone will agree with this approach, so it's important we state it here so we don't have someone with different expectations join the team.

1. If necessary, the company will purchase a linux computer. The specs will be commensurate with what your manager decides you need after discussing your job. You may not all get the same specs as others at the company.
2. If you're assigned a change in compensation, that will take a effect starting in your next pay period, not immediately, nor backdated to past hours.
3. Our approach is to pay people enough to live in reasonable comfort, typically better than local wages based on your experience level. This is very important, because if we pay too high not only is it harder for the company to afford staff, but it will result in many staff joining because of the high pay, who may not care about what really matters. It's critical that staff join because they are a good fit with our many unusual values and methods, in order to preserve our culture.
4. Once an employee has completed some OKRs and demonstrated they can push the team towards our mission, they will get a substantial raise. At this point, we trust they've been vetted to be a cultural fit. The raise will be weighted towards stock so that our greated contributors are co-owners of Countable Web Productions Inc.
5. This will absolutely lead to unequal pay - if you're good you'll be paid a lot more than someone who's still learning to be productive. On the positive side, this allows us to afford to hire students who still have some basic knowledge to develop in order to be productive. I think this is great because it will attract people who propel us forward over time, and avoid accumulating people who coast, by encouraging them to either improve or leave. It's much more motivating working with the former people.
