# Scrum

Countable's now using [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage client work and internal projects. Its a framework involving team collaboration which people can address complex problems while productively and creatively delivering products of value to our customers.

#### Backlog
The simplest definition would be a list of all the things that needs to be done within the project.

#### Sprint
A sprint is our regular repeatable 1-week work cycle during which work is completed and made ready for review. 
 
### Weekly Activities

We have a 1-week sprint:
  * Monday - For individual projects, do your **sprint planning** (move cards from the top of Backlog to your Sprint of work for the week)

  * Tuesday - **9 am is a team-wide meeting for our sprint retrospective for all projects**, and sprint planning for internal projects (Systems). After the meeting, archive your Done columns in Trello boards so you can see just the current week's progress.

  * Friday - A weekly email regarding any special or ongoing items and reminders for the next week's meeting agenda.

  * Every weekday - as you complete cards, move them to the Done column.
  
We do not have daily stand up meetings, although 3 or more of us are collaborating on one thing, we may temporarily form a daily stand up meeting for that project.

### Scrum Meeting

Our scrum meetings are made on Tuesday -within a 1 hour timeframe - where we must answer the following questions:

1) What will you do this week?
2) What will you do on the next days?
3) Are there any obstacles in your way?


Note: Instead of just talking about what did you do this week, try to use a screen share feature to walk along all of your "done" trello tickets, explaining one by one. This helps the team to better understand all of your work.
