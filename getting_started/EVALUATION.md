# Evaluation

This page is intended as a guide of what we look for to trigger promotion at the company.

Does the person do these things?   
   * Set an example of high standards in productivity and quality of work, and share with the team in the #showoff channel. Seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very motivational.
   * Take ownership of our mission (always push it forward, and question/clarify it)
   * Take responsibility for clients' results. Work towards a clear, shared goal with the client. Follow up on discussions in a constructive way (with respect to objectives). Once it's clear, prototype something to validate assumptions as quickly as possible.
   * Support your team members and help them improve. Provide honest negative feedback where due, both positive and negative (but do so with empathy, clear examples and focus on the work not the person who produced it).
   * Make consistent improvements of any size (many small ones is easier) to the systems around you. Make a PR to clarify a document or code.
   * Get very good at knowing when to escalate (ask for help) from your colleagues and client, and when to just dig deeper on your own.
   * Read the entire operations manual, ask questions about things that are hard to understand or you disagree with, index things that are hard to find when you need them, improve clarity.
   * Show gratitude to your team in the #thanks channel.

Does the person avoid these things?
   * Fail to take responsibility when you make a mistake, and learn how to prevent it next time.
   * Miss meetings or appointments
   * Dodge responsibility by passing on work to others without attempting themselves first.
   * Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in Trello, or backlog's not monitored.
   * Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
   * Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes man" without thinking about what you're agreeing to.
   * Go "dark" so clients and team mates are unclear about the project status.
