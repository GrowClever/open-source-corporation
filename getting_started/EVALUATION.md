This page lists "job levels". Each employee should be assigned a level based on the behaviours listed below from levels 1 to 4.

Things that could result in you being dismissed:
   * Fail to take responsibility when you make a mistake, and learn how to prevent it next time.
   * Miss meetings or appointments
   * Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in Trello, or backlog's not monitored.
   * Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
   * Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes man" without thinking about what you're agreeing to.
   * Go "dark" so clients and team mates are unclear about the project status.
