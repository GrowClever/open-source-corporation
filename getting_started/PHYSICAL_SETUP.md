You'll need:

  * A computer. If you're a developer, it should have either Linux or MacOS (don't use Windows for work). If you're a developer or designer, you want 4GB or more of RAM, 128GB or more of disk, and a core i3 or better CPU. We recommend dell XPS 9350, 9360, 9370.
  * A quiet, hopefully cool, room to work from with a stable internet connection. When you `ping 8.8.8.8` you should get no dropped packets or numbers over 100ms.
