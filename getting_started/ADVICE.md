# Promotion Criteria

This page is intended as a guide of what we look to trigger promotion at the company. Does the person do these things?
   
   * Set an example of high standards in productivity and quality of work. Seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very motivational.
   * Take ownership of our mission (always push it forward, and question/clarify it)
   * Take ownership of clients' results. Work towards a clear, shared goal with the client. Follow up on discussions in a constructive way (with respect to objectives)
   * Support your team members. Assess their work, give positive feedback where due. Provide honest negative feedback (but do so with empathy, clear examples and focus on the work not the person who produced it).
   * Make consistent improvements of any size (many small ones is easier) to the systems around you. Make a PR to clarify a document or code.
   * Get very good at knowing when to escalate (ask for help) from your colleagues and client, and when to just dig deeper on your own.

Does the person avoid these things?
   * Missing meetings or appointments
   * Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in Trello, or backlog's not monitored
   * Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
   * Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes man" without thinking about what you're agreeing to.
