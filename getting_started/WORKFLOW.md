# Workflow Checklist

## Every Day You Work
  * Share something with the team every day. Anything you want, but sometimes should be your actual work. Either in your specific client channel on slack or in #general (the tavern). You can either share a work sample, or tell us something you've learned or are struggling with, or some 3rd party work that inspires you. [Courtesy](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
  * Give honest feedback on some other team member's posts. [Collaboration](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
  * Fill your timesheet (end of the day) [Courtesy](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
  * Check your company Email. [Courtesy](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)

## Every Week
  * Communicate with each client you are working with. Send them an update on what's done and what's pending out of their current expectations. Include a link to staged work, and a screenshot or video. It's best to do this Friday or Monday. [Transparency](../TRANSPARENCY.md)

## Do Not
  * Use priviate messages for things that don't need to be private. Share your experiences on your projects in your client channel, and if it's more widely applicable, in #general. [Transparency](../TRANSPARENCY.md)
