# Onboarding

The goal of this guide is to help new members of Countable get connect with the team, efficiently set up accounts, and learn key things to help you get started contributing! If you find a way to improve this document, send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/pull/new/master)! If anything is unclear, let's fix it so it's clear for the next person.

  * Get a countable.ca email address (ask your manager to create it)
  * Use your email address to access our [slack](http://countable-web.slack.com).
  * Use our slack to say hi to the team.
  * Use the team to answer your other questions.

### Set up a Timesheet

  * Make your own copy of [this sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kPxAPNnCAWGFag1zHUttEtScNnVE3gQRjt0wQEFbpwI) and share full access with your manager only. Name the file "<your name>-<year, 4 digits.>-timesheet.".
  * Filling out your timesheet every day is required. Enter the time you spent on each project, rounded to the nearest half hour. Separate clients or projects go on separate lines, so you may have 3 lines for a single day.
  * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific things you worked on for most of that day. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. If you're entering the same phrase every day, you're not being specific enough. Enter detail that reminds you exactly what pieces you worked on that day.
  * If you don't know the project, put "Countable" in that column.
  * Also include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs.

### Environment
  
  * Read about our [ops](../engineering/OPERATIONS.md) and [coding standards](../engineering/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
  * Complete the [training exercises](../engineering/TRAINING.md) following these practices and get a team member to code review it using a feature branch and pull request.
  * Get invites from your team members on Trello (link), GitHub (link) and BitBucket (link) for the projects you'll be working on.

Share your username with your manager on these platforms so you can be invited into specific projects:
  * [Trello](https://trello.com/b/gycu4ydQ/opportunity-road-map)
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/countable-web)
  * [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/countable-web)

Join these using your Google account.

  * [Jenkins](http://jenkins.countable.ca)

### How to Do Work
