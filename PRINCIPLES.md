# Principles

  * _Feedback_ - If something is unclear or suboptimal, make some noise about it.
  * _Mission Driven_ - If in doubt, or principles conflict, go with the choice that is more aligned with our mission.
  * _Empowerment_ - Empower people with knowledge of high level goals and all the tools they need to work on those, and the ability to frequently share their progress towards those goals. *Sharing progress toward goals increases the chance of completion by 43%.*
  * _Collaboration_ - Collaborate with clients to exceed (ideally by orders of magniutude) a 300% ROI on the client's investment in our billables.
  * _Audacity_ - Do work that excites us and has a chance to change its industry.
  * _Transparency_ - Share everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _Housekeeping_ - Leave things a little better shape than you found them.
  * _Prototyping_ Build things as a part of planning them.
  * _Wealth_ - Maximize total value creation for everyone. Do things that could benefit lots of people even if they're not paying us. The PR alone is worth it, not to mention to moral obligation.
  * _Consistency_ - Avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to automate and enforce consistency.
  * _Modelling_ - Reduce complex phenonemna to simple predictive models.
  * _Feedback Loops_ - The output of what you do should be highly visible to those it impacts, and to you.
