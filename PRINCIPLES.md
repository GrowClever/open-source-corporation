# Principles

## Purpose

The purpose of this page is to address a specific issue with our [OKR](./OKRS.md) process, wherein by focusing exclusively on some OKR we neglect some important assumption we should have had all along. ie, by releasing fast we neglect privacy. These principles are listed in order of descending priority, but they keywords SHOULD and MUST are used to indicate which principles are require observation and which are guidelines to follow when it's practical.

## Scope

  * _Ownership_ - When the word "we" is used below, everyone MUST take responsbility. That means either do it yourself or understand who is doing it. If no one's doing it you MUST do it yourself or make some noise (See Feedback, below).
  * _Privacy through simplicity_ - We MUST alwayas be confident that anyone's private data is secure. When it comes to security private data, you SHOULD use the simplest solution as it's the most likely to be implemented correctly. The best is to never store private data. Then, if you must store it, minimize the number of people who can access it, and the ways the can access it.
  * _Feedback_ - If something is unclear or suboptimal, we SHOULD make some noise about it.
  * _Mission Driven_ - If in doubt, or principles conflict, we SHOULD go with the choice that is more aligned with our mission.
  * _Empowerment_ - We SHOULD empower people with knowledge of high level goals and all the tools they need to work on those, and the ability to frequently share their progress towards those goals. *Sharing progress toward goals increases the chance of completion by 43%.*
  * _Collaboration_ - We SHOULD collaborate with clients, forming a shared team with them when it's not to difficult to do so. For example, invite them to use our tools (Trello) and if they won't, invite yourself to use their tools so we can communicate in one place.
  * _Audacity_ - We SHOULD do work that excites us and has a chance to change its industry.
  * _Transparency_ - We SHOUOLD do everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _Housekeeping_ - We SHOULD things a little better shape than you found them.
  * _Prototyping_ We SHOULD build simple but working models of things as a part of planning them.
  * _Wealth_ - We SHOULD maximize total value creation for everyone. Do things that could benefit lots of people even if they're not paying us. The PR alone is worth it, not to mention to moral obligation.
  * _Consistency_ - We SHOULD avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to automate and enforce consistency.
  * _Modelling_ - We SHOULD reduce complex phenonemna to simple predictive models.
  * _Feedback Loops_ - The output of what you do SHOULD be highly visible to those it impacts, and to you.
  * _Diversity_ - We MUST treat everyone with respect and work to avoid non-merticratic bias.
  * _Usability_ - We SHOULD create software which is a strong user experience. Don't make the user have to think, wait, or do a task unnecessarily.
