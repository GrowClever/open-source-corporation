# Principles

This is an early draft. it's just notes and not actionable yet.
  * _The Empowerment Principle_ - Empower people with knowledge of high level goals, and the ability to make progress towards those goals. This includes lending your ear to remove roadblocks.
  * _The Collaboration Principle_ - Collaborate with clients to exceed (ideally by orders of magniutude) a 300% ROI on the client's investment in our billables.
  * _The Disrutption Principle_ - Do work that excites us and has a chance to affect change in its' industry.
  * _The Transparency Principle_ - Share everything in the most public place that doesn't endanger someone's privacy or property.
  * _The Housekeeping Principle_ - Leave things a little better shape than you found them.
  * _The Clarity Principle_ - If something is unclear, make some noise about it.
  * _The Sharing Principle_ - Maximize total value creation for everyone. Our everyday activities should result in additional content/value shared online.
  * _The Consistency Principle_ - Avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to automate and enforce consistency.
