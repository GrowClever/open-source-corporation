We want to list all the activities needed to reach our company mission, and who's accountable for each.

## Owning an AOR
  * Owning an AOR comes with great power and responsibility. Most of the time, you may manage this area as you see fit.
  * You must document and approve the AOR purpose (pertaining to mission) and objectives (for improving it) with your manager, as well as how success can be measured, in our Ops manual.
  * You must document any processeses the team is required to follow under your AOR in the Ops manual. Keep them concise and simple, don't add anything unnecessary.
  * You must champion your AOR and ensure everyone follows its process. If someone doesn't follow the process you're overseeing, you must send them a link to the documentation page.
  * Quarterly: You must evaluate how aligned the AOR's processes are with our values and principles.
  * Quarterly: You must evaluate how effectively the AOR is contributing to our mission.
