# Areas of Responsibility (AOR)

## Purpose (Why)
To determine what work matters most to Countable's mission, and make specific team members accountable for improving and tracking progress on each one. An AOR is an area of work that we've identified that someone should be responsible for. That person is the Directly Responsible Individual for the AOR, and ensures that it's cleary why the AOR is important, determines the top priority for doing better in that AOR, and tracks progress towards that priority.

## Scope (What)
This document is intended to standardize and clarify the process of owning an AOR. This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S6VesJN11u7oxYceimjOucrW-7Be62JRianhzuy68kQ/edit#gid=0) lists the responsibilities necessary for Countable to achieve its' mission, and who's accountable for them. Each responsibility is assigned an owner (directly responsible individual or DRI), and an heir who is shadowing and assisting the owner.

## How to Manage an AOR
  * Owning an AOR comes with great power and responsibility. Within the constraints of the AOR framework, you may manage your area as you see fit.
  * You MUST document and approve the AOR purpose (pertaining to mission) and objectives (for improving it) with your manager, as well as how success can be measured, in our Ops manual.
  * You MUST document any processeses the team is required to follow under your AOR in the Ops manual.
  * You MUST champion your AOR and ensure everyone follows its process. If someone doesn't follow the process you're overseeing, you must send them a link to the documentation page.
  * Quarterly: You MUST evaluate how aligned the AOR's processes are with our values and mission.
  * Quarterly: You SHOULD measure how effectively the AOR is contributing to our mission.

## Writing Ops Manual Pages
  * An Ops Manual page MUST help employees achieve our mission and create value for our customers.
  * An Ops Manual page SHOULD consist of bulleted lists of processes. (Use this document as a template)
  * You MUST have a Purpose heading which concisely summarizes why the document exists, because we want to ensure the area is important to our mission.
  * You SHOULD have a Scope section that identifies what area of work is being discussed, and any definitions to clarify what follows, because we want each process document to be focused on a specific area of work.
  * You SHOULD use clear language, with the keywords "MUST" and "SHOULD" where applicable because we want to be clear. ie, "Developers MUST use Docker for apps with more than a single process, and SHOULD use Python on Node.js for web application back ends." "MUST" means the DRI should track and work towards compliance of the process. "SHOULD" means it's a recommendation to follow when reasonably convenient.
  * You SHOULD keep your writing concise and have as few rules as possible, becasue it's easier for employees to understand. State the rules declaratively, as a matter of fact, not opinion.
  * You SHOULD add some logical purpose, evidence or citation that indicates how the rules help our mission because we want each rule to justify its' existence. However, you SHOULD judge which rules are self-evident in order to stay concise.
