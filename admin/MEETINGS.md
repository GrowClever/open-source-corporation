Agenda

  * Meetings always need a calendar event with invitations to everyone who needs to be there. If someone doesn't need to be at the meeting, dont' invite them..
  * All meetings should have a general agenda or structure to follow.
  * All meetings should also have a specific agenda sent out in advance, with as much detail as possible.
  * If someone is presenting in a meeting, they should send out materials so the attendees can get in the right headspace.
  * Don't go to meetings unless you have something specific to contribute to the project.

Minutes should be recorded for each meeting.

  * capture attendees.
  * put a note besides names that were late, or had AV issues as a reminder for them to correct it.
  * Mention "headlines" of what we talk about. What's the important point?
  * Mention any decisions.
  * Mention any notes on KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
  * Mention anything with a followup required.
  * List items to come back to on the next meeting.
  * Send a follow-up email with the minutes/notes and highlight any immediate action items
  * Correct any inaccuracies in the google doc with a strikethrough of what's written, the correct info added, and then your initials in brackets

## One-on-one meetings

One-on-one meetings between each manager and reports should be once per month.

For the employees:
1. This is your time to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you want to talk about the footy over the weekend, that's fine. If you want to talk about work or issues at home or career progression, that's fine.
2. Sometimes there is not much to talk about - and that's fine too. If they do not have much to say on a particular day and I don't have much to say, it's a short meeting.

As a manager:
1. It's a really good time as a manager to practice listening. For that reason, I never have an agenda (i.e. things I want to say) at these meetings. Try to contain the impulse to give advice unless they specifically ask for it.
2. I make it quite clear that as far as legally possible, I will maintain confidentiality. The only time that something may be relayed upward is if there is requirement for me to do so (e.g. an employee reporting harassment).
3. If they don't bring it up on their own I'll ask questions about emotional state and emotional reactions to situations. E.g., "How did you feel about that?" "Are you feeling sufficiently challenged?" "What have you learned this week?"
4. Keep a list of ongoing themes and to keep returning to them. You can do this when scheduling the next 1-on-1 in the calendar. Otherwise it's easy for an issue to drop into the background. E.g., somebody has an issue with a coworker, or is feeling bored, or thinks we have too many meetings, or thinks we don't take tech debt seriously enough. People mentioning that even once is a gift: I can't fix systemic problems if I don't know about them. And even if the system is fine, I don't want my people just putting up with their jobs. I want them happy.
