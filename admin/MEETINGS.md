Agenda

  * Meetings always need a calendar event with invitations to everyone who needs to be there. If someone doesn't need to be at the meeting, dont' invite them..
  * All meetings should have a general agenda or structure to follow.
  * All meetings should also have a specific agenda sent out in advance, with as much detail as possible.
  * If someone is presenting in a meeting, they should send out materials so the attendees can get in the right headspace.
  * Don't go to meetings unless you have something specific to contribute to the project.

Minutes should be recorded for each meeting.

  * capture attendees.
  * put a note besides names that were late, or had AV issues as a reminder for them to correct it.
  * Mention "headlines" of what we talk about. What's the important point?
  * Mention any notes on KPIs, OKRs
  * Mention anything with a followup required.
  * List items to come back to on the next meeting.
  * Send a follow-up email with the minutes/notes and highlight any immediate action items
