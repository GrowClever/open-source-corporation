# Meetings

## Purpose

Ensure meetings actually help accomplish our mission.

## Scope

Define all the meetings at Countable

## All Meetings

  * Our calendar is the source of truth regarding meeting times, attendees and cancellation status. Only updates to the calendar event count. Don't transmit this info via email or verbally, use the calendar.
  * Anyone who is late should notify the team in advance of the meeting.
  * The purpose of the meeting must be clear.
  * Recurring meetings should review the previous meeting's follow-ups/action items. Open up the last week's minutes and review them.
  * Meetings must have a general (recurring) or specific (one-off) agenda.
  * If you are presenting in a meeting, send out materials (such as slides) in advance so the attendees can get in the right headspace.
  * When you are speaking, pause to get feedback and answer questions periodically.
  * Minutes should be recorded for each meeting. This should just be a few bullet points with decisions and action items. We don't need to mention everything that was discussed. Just the "headlines". What's the important point? Action items should be transcribed into Trello.
  * Send a follow-up email with the minutes, and record them in an ongoing google-doc for recurring meetings.

## Scrum Meetings

All active projects should have a Sprint meeting every 1 or 2 weeks.
  * Mention the "north star" metric of your project and how the meeting relates to it.
  * Review the sprint column, and determine why an cards haven't been completed last sprint.

## One-on-one Meetings

One-on-one meetings between each manager and reports should be once per quarter.

For the employees:
1. This is your time to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you want to talk about the footy over the weekend, that's fine. If you want to talk about work or issues at home or career progression, that's fine.
2. Sometimes there is not much to talk about - and that's fine too. If they do not have much to say on a particular day and I don't have much to say, it's a short meeting.

As a manager:
1. It's a really good time as a manager to practice listening. For that reason, I never have an agenda (i.e. things I want to say) at these meetings. Try to contain the impulse to give advice unless they specifically ask for it for at least the first 10 minutes of the meeting.
2. I make it quite clear that as far as legally possible, I will maintain confidentiality. The only time that something may be relayed upward is if there is requirement for me to do so (e.g. an employee reporting harassment).
3. If they don't bring it up on their own I'll ask questions about emotional state and emotional reactions to situations. E.g., "How did you feel about that?" "Are you feeling sufficiently challenged?" "What have you learned this week?"
4. Keep a list of ongoing themes and to keep returning to them. You can do this when scheduling the next 1-on-1 in the calendar. Otherwise it's easy for an issue to drop into the background. E.g., somebody has an issue with a coworker, or is feeling bored, or thinks we have too many meetings, or thinks we don't take tech debt seriously enough. People mentioning that even once is a gift: I can't fix systemic problems if I don't know about them. And even if the system is fine, I don't want my people just putting up with their jobs. I want them happy.
5. Review job levels. Employees should check off each job level requirement, and self-promote when they reach completion of their current level.

## PD Meeting

We currently have a front end and backend meeting, every 2nd week.  The purpose of this meeting is:
  * Present and review each others' work from the last week.
  * "Mob" programming, create something together in the meeting.
  * Scrum meeting for countable.ca, every 2nd PD Meeting.
  * Since one-on-one meetings are only once per quarter, this can act as a group therapy session and cover any topics employees are comfortable talking about. Get an update on your team mates' lives outside work, any frustrations and ambitions.

## All-hands Meeting

The entire team meets once per month to plan work pipeline and roadmap at a high level, and practice new processes together.
