# Meetings

## Purpose

Ensure meetings actually help accomplish our mission.

## Scope

Define all the meetings at Countable

## All Meetings

  * Our calendar is the source of truth regarding meeting times, attendees and cancellation status. All updates to meeting times go directly in the calendar.
  * Meetings start on time and stop on time. If someone is late, start without them.
  * Anyone who is late should notify the team in advance of the meeting so they can proceed.
  * The purpose and agenda of the meeting must be clear, and listed in the meeting event details on the calendar.
  * Recurring meetings should review the previous meeting's follow-ups/action items. Open up the last week's minutes and review them.
  * If you are presenting in a meeting, send out materials (such as slides) in advance so the attendees can get in the right headspace.
  * Never speak for more than two minutes without pausing and letting people respond, so you can listen to your audience and steer your material to be more helpful. Meetings should be interactive, not monologues.
  * Minutes should be recorded for each meeting. This should just be a few bullet points with decisions and action items. We don't need to mention everything that was discussed. Just the "headlines". What's the important point? Action items should be transcribed into Trello.
  * Send a follow-up email with the minutes, and record them in an ongoing google-doc for recurring meetings.
  * 3W rule: Meeting follow-up actions and/or meeting summaries must contain the three Ws: WHO does WHAT by WHEN
  * Do not attend meetings if you don't have a good reason to be there.
  * The meeting organiser is responsible for a) taking notes and b) that follow-up actions (acc. to 3W rule) are noted in the minutes, and shared as Trello cards.

## Scrum Meetings

All active projects should have a Sprint meeting every 1 to 4 weeks.
  * Discuss how the current sprint will accomplish our "OKR" for the project.
  * See [Scrum](../peopleops/getting_started/SCRUM.md) for full instructions

## One-on-one Meetings

One-on-one meetings between each manager and reports should be once per quarter.

For the employees:
1. This is your time to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you want to talk about what's going on with your life, hobbies, etc, that's fine. If you want to talk about work or issues at home or career progression, that's fine.
2. We love feedback about what's good and bad at Countable. What would you change?

As a manager:
1. Practice listening. For that reason, I never have an agenda (i.e. things I want to say) at these meetings. Try to contain the impulse to give advice unless they specifically ask for it for at least the first 10 minutes of the meeting.
2. The discussion is confidential by default, unless there are suggestions or requests that come out of the discussion to relay to the team.
3. If they don't bring it up on their own I'll ask questions about emotional state and emotional reactions to situations. E.g., "How did you feel about the changes at Countable last month?", "Are you feeling sufficiently challenged?", "What have you learned this month?", "What are the worst and best thing about Countable?", "What do you find enjoyable and productive at work, andi did you get a chance to do that last month?"
4. Book the next one-on-one in the Calendar at the end of the current one, and list any issues to follow-up with. People mentioning problems even once is a gift: We can't fix systemic problems if I don't know about them. And even if the system is fine, I don't want my people just putting up with their jobs. I want them happy.
5. Review job levels. Employees should check off each job level requirement, and self-promote when they reach completion of their current level. Give the employee a simple desription of what you think would really get them "to the next level". Make this as actionable and objective as possible, and frame it as a mentor.


## PD Meeting

We currently have a front end and backend meeting, every 2nd week.  The purpose of this meeting is:
  * Present and review each others' work from the last week.
  * "Mob" programming, create something together in the meeting.
  * Scrum meeting for countable.ca, every 2nd PD Meeting.
  * Since one-on-one meetings are only once per quarter, this can act as a group therapy session and cover any topics employees are comfortable talking about. Get an update on your team mates' lives outside work, any frustrations and ambitions.

## All-hands Meeting

The entire team meets once per month to plan work pipeline and roadmap at a high level, and practice new processes together.
