Agenda

  * Our calendar is the source of truth regarding meeting times, attendees and cancellation status. Only updates to the calendar event count. Don't transmit this info via email or verbally, use the calendar.
  * The purpose of the meeting must be clear.
  * Recurring meetings should review the previous meeting's follow-ups/action items. Open up the last week's minutes and review them.
  * Meetings must have a general (recurring) or specific (one-off) agenda.
  * If you are presenting in a meeting, send out materials (such as slides) in advance so the attendees can get in the right headspace.
  * Remind anyone who is late that this waste's the team's time. They should apologise.
  * When you are speaking, pause to get feedback and answer questions.

Minutes should be recorded for each meeting. This should just be a few bullet points with decisions, action items.

  * Mention "headlines" of what we talk about. What's the important point?
  * Mention the "north star" metric of your project and how the meeting relates to it.
  * Mention anything with a followup required.
  * Send a follow-up email with the minutes, and record them in an ongoing google-doc for recurring meetings.
  * Correct any inaccuracies in the google doc with a strikethrough of what's written, the correct info added, and then your initials in brackets

## One-on-one meetings

One-on-one meetings between each manager and reports should be once per month.

For the employees:
1. This is your time to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you want to talk about the footy over the weekend, that's fine. If you want to talk about work or issues at home or career progression, that's fine.
2. Sometimes there is not much to talk about - and that's fine too. If they do not have much to say on a particular day and I don't have much to say, it's a short meeting.

As a manager:
1. It's a really good time as a manager to practice listening. For that reason, I never have an agenda (i.e. things I want to say) at these meetings. Try to contain the impulse to give advice unless they specifically ask for it for at least the first 10 minutes of the meeting.
2. I make it quite clear that as far as legally possible, I will maintain confidentiality. The only time that something may be relayed upward is if there is requirement for me to do so (e.g. an employee reporting harassment).
3. If they don't bring it up on their own I'll ask questions about emotional state and emotional reactions to situations. E.g., "How did you feel about that?" "Are you feeling sufficiently challenged?" "What have you learned this week?"
4. Keep a list of ongoing themes and to keep returning to them. You can do this when scheduling the next 1-on-1 in the calendar. Otherwise it's easy for an issue to drop into the background. E.g., somebody has an issue with a coworker, or is feeling bored, or thinks we have too many meetings, or thinks we don't take tech debt seriously enough. People mentioning that even once is a gift: I can't fix systemic problems if I don't know about them. And even if the system is fine, I don't want my people just putting up with their jobs. I want them happy.
