# Timesheets
This document standardizes the process of logging timesheets.

## Timesheet Columns
*  ### Project:
    * Write the standardized slug name of the project you worked on. If you don't know the project, put "countable" in that column.
*  ### Date:
    * Write the date in ISO 8601 format: yyyy-mm-dd.
*  ### Description of Work:
    * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific outcomes you worked on for most of that day, in a language clients will understand. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. If you're entering the same phrase every day, you're not being specific enough.
*  ### Trello or BitBucket ref:
    * Also include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs. Link to trello cards can be found in "Share and more..." after opening a card.
*  ### Hours Worked: 
    * Enter the time you spent on each project, rounded to the nearest half hour.
    
## Extra
* Do not modify the timesheet template (ex: removing/adding rows at the top of the timesheet, changing existing columns).
* Do not rename the month tabs, but changing their order is fine (you can move the current month as your first tab).
* Changing the colors of cells are ok.
* Do not merge any cells together.
* If you would like space between rows, do not have more than 1 empty row inbetween.
* For adding additional information or calculations for yourself, use the empty cells above the table headers or unused columns (F and beyond).
