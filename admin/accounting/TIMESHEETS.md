# Timesheets
This document standardizes the process of logging timesheets.

## Setting up your timesheet
  * Make your own copy of [this sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kPxAPNnCAWGFag1zHUttEtScNnVE3gQRjt0wQEFbpwI) and share full access with your manager only. Name the file `<your name>-<year, 4 digits>-timesheet`.
  * Filling out your timesheet every day is required. Separate clients or projects go on separate lines, so you may have 3 lines for a single day.

## Timesheet Columns
*  ### Project:
    * Write the standardized slug name of the project you worked on. If you don't know the project, put "countable" in that column.
*  ### Date:
    * Write the date in ISO 8601 format: yyyy-mm-dd.
*  ### Description of Work:
    * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific outcomes you worked on for most of that day, in a language clients will understand. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. If you're entering the same phrase every day, you're not being specific enough.
*  ### Trello or BitBucket ref:
    * Also include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs. Link to trello cards can be found in "Share and more..." after opening a card.
*  ### Hours Worked: 
    * Enter the time you spent on each project.

## Figuring Out What To Bill

  * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific outcomes you worked on for most of that day, in a language clients will understand. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. If you're entering the same phrase every day, you're not being specific enough.
  * If you don't know the project, put "Countable" in that column.
  * The `countable` project pays for your time training and learning things you need for your job.
  * Use the `countable` project for time discussing how Countable operates with team members.
  * If you're not sure what's billable, generally anything we ask you to do is billable, and anything we "invite" you to do is optional and not billable. Training is only billable if it's requested by the company that you complete specific materials, or you're learning something immediately required to solve a problem in your work. Attending events, conferences, etc, is not paid unless we require you to go for marketing or another purpose (but we'll often pay for your tickets in any case).
  * Billing for travel time: If we meet each other only, or go to a workspace with no clients, transit time is not billable. When visiting clients, it is billable.

## Rules
* Do not modify the timesheet template (ex: removing/adding rows at the top of the timesheet, changing existing columns).
* Do not rename the month tabs, but changing their order is fine (you can move the current month as your first tab).
* Changing the colors of cells are ok.
* Do not merge any cells together.
* If you would like space between rows, do not have more than 1 empty row inbetween.
* For adding additional information or calculations for yourself, use the empty cells above the table headers or unused columns (F and beyond).
