# Communications Charter

## Purpose

We want to restict types of communication by channel so people aren't stressed by having to listen on all channels at all times.

## Scope

Define how we use different communication channels for different purposes.

### Guidelines for All Communication
  * Where possible, communication is `asynchronous` because we have different schedules and often timezones too. This means it will often be a few hours or even a day before you get a response to Slack or Email messages.
  * For complex or emotionally charged conversations us voice (appear.in or phone)
  * Being brief in email/slack amongst ourselves is ok.
  * There are arguably two "modes" we work in. "Focus mode" and "Collaboration mode". Slack is great when you're in collaboration mode, but it's ok to turn off all channels and focus on your work too.
  * It's always better to speak up if you have a concern, or any information that might be important to the group. If you're worried about how the group will react, say so. We're all commited to speaking up, and listening respectfully. We can't make the right decision without everyone sharing all their information.
  * Talk to your team and clients every single day you work. You should indicate what you're working on, and keep track of any special deadlines set by your team. For example, when you're blocking someone else or a client requests a special deadline.

### Calendar Expectations:
  * The calendar is the single source of truth for meetings. They are only held by people invited to actual calendar events.
  * We do reply to calendar invitations (within 24h, because that's the maximum frequency for checking email)
  * We make our calendars public (to show when we're busy, not exact events).
  * We add our vacations or holidays into the event calendar as following: “Name” vacation (# of days )

### Email Hygiene:
  * We want to minimize email. Most types of things in there should be slowly pulled into other channels.
  * Email is ok for announcements but should link to something in Trello (if it requires followup) and Google Docs (if it is a resource we may need later)
  * Let’s not discuss via email. Use [reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/CountableWeb) for long form discussions that can be public. Slack for private ones.
  * The email channel is not urgent: 24h response time is ok. We recommend checking email only twice daily, only on weekdays during business hours. You must follow-up with any email within 24h of it being sent. If the email is from a colleague, customer, or prospect, you must follow up within 24h of an email being sent. If a task is requested, either complete the task or reply indicating what steps you've taken, what's still needed, and when it will be completed.
  * Respond to emails in a way that minimizes back-and-forth. Don't ask "when can you meet?", for example. Ask "I'm available at 3pm to 4pm tomorrow, does that work? If not, please summarize your requirements via email isntead."
  * No need to check emails during vacation (unless otherwise agreed upon). => see next line
  * You must have an autoresponder set when on vacaton: including return date from vacation / back-up contact and details / back-up person gets a briefing.
  * No need to reply to an FYI email (e.g. saying thanks) - you can, but don’t have to.

### Text
  * If you'd like someone's attention because you're blocked and they're not responding on Slack, we recommend you text them. Do this only when necessary.
  * This means, we should share our phone numbers, but only use them for urgent requests.

### Appear.in (Video Chat, and in-perosn meetings)
Guidlines for communicating face-to-face
  * Make eye contact 50% of the time when speaking, and 100% of the time when listening.
  * Never speak for more than 1 minute without pausing for the other person to speak. If they don't, then you can continue.
  * Get in the habit of repeating things back to people concisely in your own words. It proves you actually heard them and gave it some thought.
  * Everyone in a group should speak some of the time, with contributions as equal as possible.

### Phone
  * For truly urgent or critical things, we call each other (cell phone). Only do this in the evening or weekend of the recipient's timezone if it's an emergency. This should be RARE.

### Trello
  * Trello is for tracking what we need to get done (reminders). We use variants of Scrum, details [here](../peopleops/getting_started/TRELLO.md).

### Office Hours and Presence:
  * Overall objective: achieving our goals but also balancing work & private life in a meaningful way
  * However, also take team spirit, team efficiency and feeling of togetherness into account.
  * Make sure your calendar is up-to-date and shared/public so we know how to reach someone if urgent

### Meetings in General
See [meetings](./MEETINGS.md)

### Reddit
  * Use old.reddit.com/CountableWeb for public discussions. Private discussions can be held on slack. Try to make any discussion you can public, assuming personal and client's competitive information can be left out.

### Slack Hygiene

Use the following notification setting. You should only be notified when people direct message or mention you, and only during your work hours. ![Slack Notification Setting](recommended-slack-setting.png)

  * Go straight to the point. Don't send people messages to check if someone's online, like "Clark", "hey, you there?", or "Can I ask you a question?". This sucks, because the person now has to stare at the screen for 2 minutes while you write them a message. Just get to the point and don't worry about when, they'll reply when they can. The expected response time on slack is up to 4 hours. When people are in "focus mode", they shouldn't have slack open as it's a distraction.
  * If the message could be useful to more than one person, post it in the most relevant public or project channel.
  * No instant reply required. Our communication priority order is: 1) Call/Text 2) Slack 3) Email 4) Trello 5) Reddit
  * Try to interact with the team about twice per work day on slack, but don't leave it open all day, you need some quiet time to focus on work. Catch up on your channels, skim and respond where needed.
  * if you read something on a public slack channel, understand it, and find it useful, please give a thumbs up :thumbsup: or :heavy_check_mark: or whatever emoticon . It helps the people who post in public channels the most to know who's read things and what to post.
  * The perfect example of what to use Slack for is: (1) When you're blocked by something, make noise to the team channel. (2) Create clarity around objectives and user stories. State your understanding in your own words so team mates can confirm we're on the same page.
