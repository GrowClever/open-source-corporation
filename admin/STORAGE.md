# Storage

We should store things only in the places and ways described below.

| System  | What Goes Here | Who Has Access |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GitHub - this repo  | Document how and why we do things | Everyone in the world |
| GitHub | Open source code | Everyone in the world |
| Trello | Work requests, tasks | The specific client and project staff |
| Bitbucket | Private source code | The specific client and project staff |
| Google Drive `/clients/<client name>` folder | Private client files (such as artwork) | The specific client and project staff |
| Google Drive `/countable/` folder | Private company data (minimize this) | Our staff |
| Google Drive `/public/` folder | Any public assets (maximize this) | Everyone in the world |
| Google Drive (your own folders) | Anything not ready to show off (minimize this) | You |
| Your local computer | No more than one day's work | You |

## Folder Structure on Google Drive

  * Files should be stored in an pleasing, intuitive heirarchy.
  * If you're unsure what folders to make, keep in mind what someone will be *doing* when they need the file. What activity does it relate to? Use folders named according to the activity so it's in context for when it's actually being used. ie, for a coding standard, it's needed when `coding` or `setting up`. This is more useful than putting it in a folder called `standards` or even `engineering` for example, because a programmer might not look there as readily.
  * When a file is no longer needed, outdated, or otherwise more likley to confuse than help, move it to a folder named ARCH in the same directory. This allows us to easily find deleted materials if needed and not risk losing them if they turn out important. Knowing this, we'll much more aggressively archive things in order to keep folders "clean".
