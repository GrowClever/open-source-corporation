# Storage

We should store things only in the places and ways described below.

| System  | What Goes Here | Who Has Access |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GitHub - this repo  | Document how and why we do things | Everyone in the world |
| GitHub | Open source code | Everyone in the world |
| Trello | Work requests, tasks | The specific client and project staff |
| Bitbucket | Private source code | The specific client and project staff |
| Google Drive `/clients/<client name>` folder | Private client files (such as artwork) | The specific client and project staff |
| [Google Drive `/team/` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12iWzlcOP_qdFlVcM_U1yLVKB6IDq4Uvd) | Private company data (minimize this) | Our staff |
| [Google Drive `/public/` folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Do2l9oaPHlyJ-J6w-BoGAvUmJjK1mDk3) | Any public assets (maximize this) | Everyone in the world |
| Google Drive (your own folders) | Anything not ready to show off (minimize this) | You |
| Your local computer | No more than one day's work | You |

## Folder Structure on Google Drive

### General Guidelines
  * Our work should be organized based on how how it's used. For example, artwork will typically need an editable copy for developers.
  * The goal is to be able to find the things we need quickly. Things we use more often should take fewer clicks.
  * Make sure your work is stored in a way that is convenient for those who will be using it.
  * When a file is no longer needed, outdated, or otherwise more likley to confuse than help, move it to a folder named ARCH in the same directory. This allows us to easily find deleted materials if needed and not risk losing them if they turn out important. Knowing this, we'll much more aggressively archive things in order to keep folders "clean".

### Canonical Folders
(draft)
  * Each project and client has a specific "slug" or identifying string, and a "acronym" which is a short version to be used throughout the company. [private list of Countable slugs here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11IvCJCtw0iD4vWEOY_tNMvpUnte2eb1Z3exMMtevIzk/edit#gid=279543225)
  * Please structure design assets as follows [ image ]
  * For Reviews, please use the format YYYY.MM.DD_
  * When creating a new project in Google Drive, copy the template linked [ here ]
