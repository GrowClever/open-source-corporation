# Priorities

This is an ordered list of priorities when doing work for clients.

1. Critical downtime events. If a service has a serious loss of function the top priority is to restore it, keeping the client updated as you go.
2. Communicating with clients. Check emails and Trello at least twice per day (I recommend exactly twice). Prefer Trello for all task related communication. Respond to emails from clients addressing their concerns. If you don't know how, CC the appropriate person (your manager if unsure) in your response asking for their input. In your response, indicate the time which you expect technical items addressed. ie) "This will be done by Thursday" and set that date in the Trello ticket if you need a reminder.
3. Fixing high impact bugs. Things which affect other team members' or your own work, or are highly visible to the client.
4. Communicating with the team. Take the opportunity when other team members are on slack with you to get in sync about shared projects and work.
5. Ensure you understand the real value of what you're working on. Why is it worth your time to someone?
6. Implement features top to bottom in the Backklog column of your trello board, to minimize how much work ends up being late.
