# Processes

# Scope

Processes are rules about how we work.

# Purpose

Slowly evolve our company's processes to produce better, more meaningful work faster, achieve our missiong, and have more fun doing it. Processes have a cost, so we want the minimum set to accomplish this.

## Identifying A New Process

The proposed process must:
  * Have a clear benefit that outweighs its cost substantially. When in doubt, eliminate the process.
  * Be as simple with the minimum number of steps necessary.
  * Be informed by our own experiences and evidence first, consultation with colleagues second, best practices third (processes well known and contained in multiple industry standards), and specific literature from a single author a distant fourth.
  * Be aligned with our mission.

## Creating A New Process

Don't rush a new process. Trial it first:
  * Document the process in this operations manual as a draft. Be clear about when the process applies, what the roles are and why it's worth having in concise simple language.
  * Explain it to a select subset of our team, and get feedback. Trailing a process is a consultative decision.
  * Lead by example, and update your process document as you learn.
  * Review the process with the team, and submit a draft for approval to roll it out company-wide if you still think it's a good idea.
