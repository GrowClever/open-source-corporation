#OBJECTIVE

In the spirity of consistency and simplicity, we want our processes themselves to be consistent in form. Processes are algorithms, lists of steps we follow for completing specific tasks.


## Defining Processes

1. If you identify a routine task for which no process is already defined, continue to step 2.
2. Write down the process as a list of sequential steps.
3. Try to make the steps are clear, with no room for interpretation.
4. Ensure the process adds real value. That is, they must be able to justify their existence. Any process document should have a rationale heading.
5. Try to simplify the process. Seek to eliminate unnecessary steps.
6. Try to make the process condusive to automation, or convention. It's more important to minimize the number of *manual* checklists and steps.

## Improving Processes

1. When a process is used, we may find deficiencies or opportunities for improvement. If so, move to step 2.
2. Re-do steps 2 through 5 of [#Defining Processes]

# Templates

Templates should be markdown, or public [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JfcXagifO5wmixA-vjI_qgYs1qzw4-dM) charts or sheets.

# Memos

This is a catch-all for documents which are neither processes nor templates.
