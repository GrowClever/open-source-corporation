# Objectives and Key Results

## Purpose

Teams who write down individual goals and regularly report progress to team members are 43% more likely to complete them. OKRs are a structured form of Goal-setting.

## Scope

Define how we implement OKRs at Countable.

## Process

At the beginning of each month, in our all-hands meeting:
  * Each _team_ should identify their top objective. It should be ambitious.
  * Write down that Objective in the project's Slack Channel Purpose field.
  
  * Following that, indicate what (about 3) measurable Key Results would tell you if you met the objective. These are _sufficient_ conditions for the objective to be met.

During your sprint meetings, review your Objective and Key Results for 5 minutes.
  * What percent done are the key results?
  * Is your sprint getting you closer?

At the beginning of the next month:
  * If designed well, it should be possible to objectively measure your Key Result as a percentage done.

## Save each Team's OKRs in Slack

Use the slack "Channel Purpose" field for each channel in slack for our OKRs to keep them visible and make sure we're actually working on them, and don't get distracted. Only #general and #client-<name> channels will have this, where #general is for Countable's OKRs. The format is:

```
Objective
   Key Result
   Key Result
   ...
```
