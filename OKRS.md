# Objectives and Key Results

(draft)

Teams who write down individual goals and regularly report progress to team members are 43% more likely to complete them.

At the beginning of the month, in our all-hands:
  * Each team should choose one Objective per month.
  * It should be the most important thing they could do to improve the company, and should be agreed on with your manager.
  * For inspiration, ask "What challengs are the team facing?", "What are my strengths I could leverage more, or weaknesses I could mitigate?"
  * Write down that Objective in a shared Google Doc.
  * Following that, indicate what measurable Key Result would tell you if you met the objective.
  * During your sprint meetings, you must remind everyone what your OKR is, and describe your progress, whether your tickets are helping, and what you'll do this sprint.

At the beginning of the next month:
  * If designed well, it should be possible to measure you key result as a percentage.
  * Give yourself a score between 0 and 100% for your key result.
  * Your manager will also give you a score between 0 and 100% for your key result.
