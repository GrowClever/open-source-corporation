# Objectives and Key Results

## Purpose

Teams who write down individual goals and regularly report progress to team members are 43% more likely to complete them. OKRs are a structured form of Goal-setting.

## Scope

Define how we implement OKRs at Countable.

Each team should have at least one *objective* or what they want to accomplish together in the short term. It's their strategic focus. Each objective has a few *key results* which are measurable, sufficient condtions for the objective to be met.

## Process

At the beginning of each month, in our all-hands meeting:
  * Each _team_ should identify their top objective.
  * It should be ambitious but possible.
  * Ask, "why" is this your objective? Why not something else?
  
  * Following that, indicate what (about 3) measurable Key Results would tell you if you met the objective. These are _sufficient_ conditions for the objective to be met.

During your sprint meetings, review your Objective and Key Results for 5 minutes.
  * What percent done are the key results?
  * Is your sprint getting you closer?

At the beginning of the next month:
  * If designed well, it should be possible to objectively measure your Key Result as a percentage done.

### Our OKR Spreadsheet

Each month's OKRs are captured here, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trSTphquGTPl9-cQKciidLAipuFnYEZHu4MYXuefP8k/edit#gid=1942082043

### Committed OKRs

The OKRs in our spreadsheet have strategic "one-off" objectives, that represent what we want to change in the world. However, there are also many things that we don't want to change. These "committed OKRs" are things we should.

#### Objective: Availability
Our web apps should never lose core functionality for more than a few minutes.

  * Key Result: Ensure test e2e coverage of core workflows OR you must test core workflows manually each release.
  * Key Result: Don't push code that fails tests. If you do, fix it within an hour or roll back.

#### Objective: Responsiveness to Clients
Clients should perceive us as responsive, reliable and rigorous.

  * Key Result: No client inquiry takes more than one business day to recieve a response.
  * Key Result: No regression (bug introduced) should exist in production for more than one business day.
