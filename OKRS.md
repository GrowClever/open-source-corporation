# Objectives and Key Results

## Purpose

Teams who write down individual goals and regularly report progress to team members are 43% more likely to complete them. OKRs are a structured form of Goal-setting.

## Scope

Define how we implement OKRs at Countable.

Each team should have at least one *objective* or what they want to accomplish together in the short term. It's their strategic focus. Each objective has a few *key results* which are measurable, sufficient condtions for the objective to be met.

## Process

At the beginning of each month, in our all-hands meeting:
  * Each _team_ should identify their top objective.
  * It should be ambitious but possible.
  * Ask, "why" is this your objective? Why not something else?
  
  * Following that, indicate what (about 3) measurable Key Results would tell you if you met the objective. These are _sufficient_ conditions for the objective to be met.

During your sprint meetings, review your Objective and Key Results for 5 minutes.
  * What percent done are the key results?
  * Is your sprint getting you closer?

At the beginning of the next month:
  * If designed well, it should be possible to objectively measure your Key Result as a percentage done.
