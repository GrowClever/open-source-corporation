# Objectives and Key Results

(draft)

Teams who write down individual goals and regularly report progress to team members are 43% more likely to complete them.

At the beginning of each month, in our all-hands meeting:
  * Each team should identify their top objective. It should be ambitious.
  * Write down that Objective in a shared location.
  * Following that, indicate what (about 3) measurable Key Results would tell you if you met the objective. These are _sufficient_ conditions for the objective to be met.
  * During your sprint meetings, review your Objective and Key Results. What percent done are the key results? Is your sprint getting you closer?

At the beginning of the next month:
  * If designed well, it should be possible to objectively measure your Key Result as a percentage done.
