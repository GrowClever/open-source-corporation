The purpose of this section is to standardize key (not all) engineering processes in order to improve the team's performance, and take advantage of an experience curve by eliminating arbitrary process differences.

## Stack Choices

We don't want to support every stack, so we chose the best for most cases and want to pass on the benefits of a superior stack to our clients, rather than them making an uninformed choice. Our stack selection is based on the following (descending importance):

1. Popularity, growth, longevity and community support.
2. Power, generality, flexiblity and interoperability.
3. Open Source, inclusive community.
4. Ease of use, readability, simplicity.
5. Performance.

We've found the following stack to be very good on these metrics.

  * Python
  * Node.js
  * Django / Flask / Express
  * Unix (Ubuntu Linux for servers)
  * PostgreSQL

Python in particular is a very strong general purpose stack choice. With "software eating the world", Python's been the condiment of choice, and is appearing in many niche industries. This lets us synergize with other of our clients' projcts, staff and expertise within the same lingua franca.
