The purpose of this section is to standardize key (not all) engineering processes in order to improve the team's performance, and take advantage of an experience curve by eliminating arbitrary process differences.

## Approach

This is how we build things.

  * [Build a prototype](./PROTOTYPING.md) first to validate everything (market, feasibility, usefulness). It's encouraged to take shortcuts as long as your project is just a prototype and not used in production.
  * When a prototype is validated, it transitions to a product and must be made maintainable.
  * When working on existing projects (products), always leave things in a little better state than you found it.
