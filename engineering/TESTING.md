## Do

  * Write tests to increase confidence our customers' experience will be good.
  * To exercise important flows like signing up, purchasing, core product experience.
  * Consider real world inputs and usage more than coverage metrics.
  * Prefer e2e tests, the highest possible level, over unit tests (most of the time).
  * Tie test cases to unchanging real world business logic, not implementation. This prevents their need to be rewriten during refactors.
