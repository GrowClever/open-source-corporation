# Developer Training

For this training, be sure to follow the practices [here](../engineering).

# Kick Off

Clone [this repository] (our operations manual).

```
git clone https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation.git
```

We recommend installing an editor, like Sublime Text, VS Code, or GitHub Atom (my current favourite). PyCharm can also work well if you prefer an IDE. We'll reimburse a licence if you want one Sublime to PyCharm.

Find a mistake, or something that could be more clear or useful in this repository. Edit the corresponding markdown file you've cloned.
