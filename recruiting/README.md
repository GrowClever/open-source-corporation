## Recruiting Process

The goal is to only accept people who are the best possible fit. Finding the best people is one of the top challenges in our industry, so we need every advantage we can find in this way. We do this by:

  * Having our process act as a "funnel" for the right applicants.
  * Encouraging a high volume of applicants (wide funnel mounth)
  * Being clear about our high expectations, compensation range, technology used, culture, and that we're remote in the posting. This will help prevent anyone who doesn't like the above from applying.
  * Having a specific instruction in the application for cover letter formatting to filter mass applications out.
  * Having a friendly letter to acknowledge the people who made it part way into the process. It's great to feel empathy for candidates, and we want to help them with their future applications. This is important because 99% or more candidates won't be accepted, and it reduces pressure on staff to make exceptions to our process.

## Non-acceptance Letter

*if* if the candidate didn't correctly format their cover letter, there's no need to respond as it's likely a mass/automated application.

Otherwise, respond as follows:
```
Hello, and thanks again for your application. We want to notify you that we won't be moving you to the next step in our selection process. We have an extremely selective process and less than 1% of candidates are selected so you've done well to make it to this point.
```

*if* the Candidate has made it to the *Technical Test* stage, the lead of the team they're applying for should also write a personal note with explanation of scoring, how to do better next time, and if they have a 80% or better score that we will consider them for future positions.

## Initial Screening

  * We should always have active job postings for positions as long as we'd consider the best possible applicant if they did happen to apply.
  * We should improve our company profile so the right people will apply.
  
### Point system

  * 1 point for communication ability. No point awarded if candidates who miss the cover letter formatting requirement
  * 1 point for for writing ability. Reject if you see poor English, grammar errors, spelling mistakes in the cover letter.
  * 1 point for having 2 or more years of technical experience in all requested domains/technologies. Or, 1 year and a computer science degree (not IT diploma).
  * 1 point for a well designed/formatted resume.
  * 1 point for portfolio links. Candidate should have at least one link to good quality content they built, which looks professional. Great if this is on a platform like Dribbble or Behance. A github.com profile with some projects counts as well.
  * 1 point for any outstanding item. This could include an open source project or contributions (many GitHub stars), many followers on a professional profile like Dribbble, going to a top school and receiving academic honours, having worked at Google, etc.
  
Candidates with less than 4 points are rejected outright. Those with 4 points other than "communication ability" can be offered a chance to re-read the application and format it correctly, answering the hidden question. This is required for them to advance.

## Technical Test

Now, answer their questions about the company. Candidates with 4 or 5 stars may now take the technical screening. This consists of a simulation of the actual work we expect them to be able to do very effectively. If any of these criteria are missed, reject the candidate.

  * The technical test should be performed with a 90% score.
  * The technical test represents baseline work and should be completed effortlessly by the candidate.
  * If the candidate wastes any time of their own or the interviewer's time with unnecessary or unclear communication, they will be rejected.

## Interview

If the technical test is completed with a 90% score, the candidate will receive a video interview with the leader of the team they're applying for, and with the Director of our company. The selection critieria at this point are for very promising candidates, and are specfic to each team. The guideline for advancement:

  * The interview criteria should be determined in advance, and candidate must receive a 90% score.
  * If in doubt, reject the candidate, as type 2 errors are more expensive.
  * Only accept the candidate if you would love working with them.

## Final Screening

The team will be shown the candidates original cover letter, technical test, interview notes. Any 2 team members who wouldn't love to work with the candidate may veto their hire.

## Acceptance

If the candidate is accepted, they will be given an offer letter written by the team lead and director.
