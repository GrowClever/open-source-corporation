# Methodology

This is a primer on our team's approach to methodologies used to structure our work.

In general, we do not take a prescriptive approach to methodology. We use methodologies as a toolbox. First, seek to understand the problem as deeply as possible. Then, evaluation methodologies and select those which best address the specific context for your project.

Here is a guide to specific methods, and when to use each.

1) Scrum - A versatile project management methodology which provides efficient change management (via backlog), regular meetings with stakeholders, continuous deployment and project velocity measurement.
2) Prototyping - Man plans, god laughs. Instead of planning every detail (guessing), why not build a quick approximation of your end goal? Prototyping an excellent way to conduct and validate planning. A cheap prototype lets you validate technical feasibility, market fit, usabilit and aesthetics without guessing (planning)
3) Wireframes - A lighter prototype that only includes the navigation (page structure) of your product.
4) Use cases - Determine who will use the product, and how. What specific goals do users have and what steps does your product take to fulfill them?
5) User stories - A variation on Use Cases, and part of Scrum. Emphasizes a deep understanding of the Actor's point of view and context.
6) Visual Mockups - A non-functional prototype. Displays the exact look of the finished product.
7) SEO Research - Focused on search engines, but serves well as a general purpose market research tool. Identify what words your market uses, and the volume of searches with those words. Then, get ranked well for them.
8) Usability testing - Observe actual users interacting with your product, and identify obstacles and opportunities in their behaviour.
9) Creative brief - A lightweight design process kick-off document to identify the project goal, audience, proposed tone/character, and summarize design deliverables.
