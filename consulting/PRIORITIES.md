1. Critical downtime events. If a service has a serious loss of function the top priority is to restore it, keeping the client updated as you go.
2. Communicating with clients. Check emails and Trello at least twice per day. Respond to emails from clients addressing their concerns. If you don't know how, CC the appropriate person (your manager if unsure) in your response asking for their input. In your response, indicate the time which you expect technical items addressed. ie) "This will be done by Thursday" and set that date in the Trello ticket if you need a reminder.
3. Fixing bugs and issues that block other work.
4. Implement features to minimize how much work ends up being late.
