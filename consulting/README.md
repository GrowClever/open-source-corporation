# Consulting

The purpose of this section is to share knowledge about providing the best results for clients.

### Project Management

We use Trello because:
  * it allows collaboration with clients on assignments.
  * is simple enough for people to join ad-hoc without training.

### Billing
  * Clients are billed monthly based on consultant timesheets.
  * Any technical work done for a client is rounded up to the nearest hour. This is intended as a reasonable incentive for clients to help us reduce context switching costs without being long enough to actively encourage context switching on our end.

### Methodology
  * Understand the client's business.
  * Nurture a clear domain language and use it in software development.
  * Nurture a relationship of collaboration, and of increasing the pie rather than splitting it.
  * Use agile methodology as a toolkit, where applicable.
  * Build systems which avoid recurring maintenance through choice of stable components and automation. It's best to work ourselves out of a job.
  * Identify big opportunities for wealth creation and high expected (statistically) ROI. Small risks are worthwhile if there is a high upside.
