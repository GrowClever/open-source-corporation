# Consulting

The purpose of this section is to share knowledge about providing the best results for clients.

### Project Management

We use Trello because:
  * it allows collaboration with clients on assignments.
  * is simple enough for people to join ad-hoc without training.

### Billing
  * Clients are billed monthly based on consultant timesheets.
  * Any technical work done for a client is rounded up to the nearest hour. This is intended as a reasonable incentive for clients to help us reduce context switching costs without being long enough to actively encourage context switching on our end.

### Methodology
  * Understand the client's business.
  * Nurture a clear domain language and use it in software development.
  * Nurture a relationship of collaboration, and of increasing the pie rather than splitting it.
  * Use agile methodology as a toolkit, where applicable.
  * Build systems which avoid recurring maintenance through choice of stable components and automation. It's best to work ourselves out of a job.
  * Identify big opportunities for wealth creation and high expected (statistically) ROI. Small risks are worthwhile if there is a high upside.
  * Consultants (technical or non) work directly with clients, and no intermediary. The consultant must learn when is appropriate to escalate, such as: before providing a quote or estimate of new work; when in doubt about the best way to capture ROI; when uncertain about an impactiful decision.

### Quotes
Clients may request a budget in an RFP, or a quote for a specific piece of work. Keep the following in mind:
  * Break the work down into about 1 day line items (8 hours), with appropriate level of detail. On larger projects, up to a week can be in a single line item.
  * Our minimum quotable amount is $3,000. Amounts below this should instead be approved via a simple email message or Trello ticket from someone authorized to approve the work.
  * Separate quotes or budgets to be completed at different times/phases, or as substantially different projects.
