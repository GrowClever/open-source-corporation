# Feedback Loops on Your Work At Countable

## Purpose

Help everyone at Countable get feedback on our work every day, and give clients visibility of our work.

## Scope

Specific tactics for getting feedback.

## Process

### Feedback Sources

This is a list of the different places you can get feedback from, depending on what's most helpful. You don't need them all for every project, but you should _use at least one of them each day_, ideally several times per day.

#### Clients
  * Where possible, talk or email with clients directly *rather than getting your manager to relay information*.
  * Provide screenshots and a report discussing your work to your clients at least once per week, and as often as once per day in between. If you don't have access to the client, send this to your manager instead.
  * Ship your work every sprint (usually 2 weeks), and show them a link to your changes.

#### Metrics
  * What can you measure that captures the value of your work. Ask your team and manager to figure this out.
  * Use your "key results" from our OKR spreadsheet. Your job is to get a score of "1" on these, and by estimating your score, you can get feedback by yourself.

#### End-users
  * These people are often your client's customers. It's whoever actually uses the product you're working on.
  * Talk to them. Connect with them any way you can so they can tell you about their experience and thoughts. Send them a video, screenshot or update on new features they've asked about, and ask them what they think.

#### Testing
  * Use the software yourself and pretend to be a user. The goal is to get inside your persona's head.
  * Write automated tests.
  * Use this sparingly as it's less reliable as outside feedback.

#### Your Team
  * Discuss all the above results with your team, and show them your work, asking for how to improve.
  * Send your team screenshots, videos, code reviews and other artefacts of what you did.

#### Your Manager
  * Your manager can give you feedback sometimes, but their more important job is to help you get feedback from the real word (see above)
