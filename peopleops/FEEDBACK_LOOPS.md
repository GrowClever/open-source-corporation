# Feedback Loops on Your Work At Countable

## Purpose

Help everyone at Countable get feedback on our work every day, and give clients visibility of our work.

## Scope

Specific tactics for getting feedback.

## Process

### Feedback Sources

This is a list of the different places you can get feedback from, depending on what's most helpful. You don't need them all for every project, but you should _use at least one of them each day_, ideally several times per day.

#### Clients
  * Where possible, talk or email with clients directly *rather than getting your manager to relay information*.
  * Provide screenshots and a report discussing your work to your clients at least once per week, and as often as once per day in between. If you don't have access to the client, send this to your manager instead.
  * Ship your work every sprint (usually 2 weeks), and show them a link to your changes.

#### Metrics
  * What can you measure that captures the value of your work. Ask your team and manager to figure this out.
  * Use your "key results" from your OKRs to determine what to measure.

#### Users
  * Talk to the users who spend time in your software directly. Send them a video, screenshot or update on new features they've asked about, and ask them what they think.

#### Testing
  * Use the software yourself and pretend to be a user.

4. key results - every month we write down the most important items to get feedback from. they're called 'key results'. Your job is to get a score of "1" on these, and by estimating your score, you can get feedback by yourself.
5. your team - discuss all the above results with your team, and show them your work, asking for how to improve.
6. your manager - your manager can give you feedback sometimes, but their more important job is to help you get feedback from the real word (see above) (edited) 

I'm going to expand this into a team email and ops manual page.
Anyway, please know that I'm not angry, I just want to be honest about problems and solve them. In extreme cases this could mean someone moving on to a different job because we're not aligned but that's not the first thing we'd try.
