# Trello

We use Trello for project management, as it's simple to set up access to the appropriate boards by partners and clients. A Trello board consists of a set of Cards (tasks) in the following columns.

### Trello Board Columns

#### Ideas
Stuff that's not clear enough to be in backlog yet.

#### Requests
Cards the client has requested that are not reviewed by the team yet. This is the starting point for anyone to add cards. We shouldn't leave cards here for long. If they're actionable, move them to Backlog. If they're not, write a comment to the client asking for more information in order to make it actionable, and leave it in the deferred column. If any additional requirements steps such as a mockup are required, mention that in the card. Attach any additional examples and/or specifications to the card.

#### Feedback

On this column, we may store cards that somehow needs our clients or manager review before proceeding into accomplishment. In practical terms, we use this section whenever we need some client data or feedback to proceed with our current task.

#### Backlog
Cards that are clear and actionable, and have an estimated impact and effort associated. This is the traditional Scrum backlog list, ordered by priority (highest on top)

#### Sprint
Cards actively being worked on in the current week.

#### Done
Cards that are ready to be tested by the client (and where not possible, the consultant). A test can take the form of a client approval, code review, or automated test written.

### Moving cards between columns

### Progress Awareness

**It's essential to maintain our clients informed about our current progress** on particular tasks, so our professional relationship is strengthened and trust is built. For this objective, we suggest that you:
1) Take screenshots of finished progress (when applicable) and post on your trello ticket.
2) Use checklists for keeping track of what's being done.
3) Use of an "Ongoing..." tag, on the ticket that you're currently working on.
4) Use of "Screencastify" chrome extension for recording short screencasts and attaching into your trello ticket

### Proper use of tags (labels)

We highly recommend the usage of Trello tags for a visual organization on cards of different contexts. For example, you may use tags such as front-end, back-end, database, testing, bugs, and information. It makes our work clearer when we filter cards within the same scope, so it increases our productivity and avoids complexity.

#### Conventions

Use a *red* label for bugs. These cards should be done first and can interrupt the current sprint.
Use a *amber* label for blocked tickets. These are tickets waiting on something and not yet actionable.

### Boards

We typically have one board per codebase with a client, and one per internal product / project. The board background color indicates the following:
  * Green - nonprofit client (private)
  * Orange - corporate client (private)
  * Red - internal operations (private)
  * Purple - open source project, or other public board (public)
  * Blue - internal product (private)

### Getting everything into Trello

Clients will often email you rather than use Trello. This can be fixed by forwarding their email to the trello board. Go to their Trello board, and click settings -> email-to-board settings, and add that email address as a contact in your email. You can then forward emails directly to your trello board. However, it does make a bit of a mess since email signature images and other junk show up in the tickets, so it's nice to clean them up when you look at them in Trello.
