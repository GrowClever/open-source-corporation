# People Ops

The purpose of this section is to make Countable a great place to work!

## Onboarding

  * Go through each step of [
  ./ONBOARDING.md]
## Hiring

  * Countable does not take into account, race and gender in hiring decisions or salary offers. Hiring should be done as if these attributes are not known at the time of offer.
  * Countable wants to hire people who are both technically strong and are self-motivated, creative problem solvers.
  * We use [this](./recruiting/POSTING.md) job posting.
  * We try to be always hiring, in order to snap up the right person if they come along at any time.
