# Giving Feedback

## Purpose

Our team must provide each other with feedback regularly in order to improve. Some references on why this is:

  * When a thoughtful dissenting opinion is introduced to a discussion, it quadruples the chance of the group finding the best answer (study cited in Originals, book)
  * Feedback from peers is the most effective way to grow professionally. (Originals)
  * Honest feedback prevents the perils of "group think" that damages teams as they grow. (Culture code)

### Guidelines

  * When someone does something you like, let them know! That's how we get them to do it more.
  * Remember the purpose of feedback. We have a team so we can help each other improve.

### Giving Negative Feedback

Giving negative feedback can be hard, as we don't want to offend. The problem is often that people just say "I don't like X" with no explanation. Instead:

  * If you're not sure what the problem is, try being subtle first. Pause to show you're thinking and then ask "does that really work?"
  * If you do have evidence of what the problem is, be very specific. It's not about your opinion, it's about the facts, so be very clear what your reason is for preferring something else.
  * Make it clear the goal is to improve the work, and you're giving feedback because you have high expectations, but you think the other person can meet them.
  * If you can, be constructive, suggest an alternative, and state clearly why you prefer it.
