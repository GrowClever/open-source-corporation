# HR Policies

Purpose: Rather than draw attention (especially in negative ways) to our differences, let's focus on building a shared culture we all love that's respectful of, but doesn't overly dwell on, all our diverse cultural values.

1. If any team lead (person with direct reports) is aware of disrespectful conduct that is clearly based on appearance-related factors not related to actual work performance (better word to catch all?), that's grounds for immediate dismissal. A single warning may be issued instead at the lead's discretion. The warning must be made public to the team so everyone can see what happened, and worded in a way that doesn't intrude on the victim's privacy (the aggressor's privacy is not an issue here). If the offence was made out of ignorance and not malice, a warning should be chosen.
2. Countable treats everyone meritocratically regardless of race, gender, religion or other attributes not related to work. This also means there is as a general rule no special provisions made for these groups, and it's the responsibility of minority groups to make their preferences simple and clear for the team to observe.
3. It's the responsibility of the victim to tell their manager of the offence, if the manager is not aware. (edited)
