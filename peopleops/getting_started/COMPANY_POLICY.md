# HR Policies

Purpose: Let's approach our differences in a respectful and positive way and focus on building a shared culture we all love that's respectful of, but doesn't overly dwell on, all our diverse cultural values.

1. If any team lead is aware of disrespectful conduct, the lead should issue a warning the first time, and if it recurs, immediate dismissal. The warning must be made public to the team so everyone can see what happened, and worded in a way that doesn't intrude on the victim's privacy (the aggressor's privacy is not an issue here).
2. Countable treats everyone meritocratically regardless of race, gender, religion or other attributes not related to our work. This also means there is as a general rule no special provisions made for these groups, and it's the responsibility of minority groups to make their preferences simple and clear for the team to observe.
3. It's the responsibility of the victim to tell their manager of the offence, if the manager is not aware.
4. This policy is NOT intended to discourage negative feedback on our work. Negative feedback, offered with empathy and from your professional peers is one of the fastest professional development tools.
