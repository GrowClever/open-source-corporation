# Workflow Checklist

These are mostly things we should already be doing. If it's something we're still working towards, it's in _italics_.

## Meetings
  * Be on time, or notify as early as possible about absence or lateness and offer something instead (here's my summary so you can read it). See Commitments, below.
  * _Everyone should share something. Prepare what you want to say (that fits the meeting agenda), and even send it to team members before the meeting._
  * If you have a proposal or idea, write it up in detail, and share it ahead of time. Indicat how it impacts something we care about (Value, OKR or Mission).

## Commitments
  * Be clear and specific about commitments. Say "I'll send you a prototype link at 2pm" rather than "I'll be done after lunch". _This should be in writing, such as in a Trello ticket (in this case, set a deadline on the ticket too.)_
  * If you're not going to meet a commitment, tell the team as early as possible, and explain what the gap will be, and how close you are. Explain what else you can do to help.

## Every Day You Work
  * Share something with the team every day. Anything you want, but sometimes should be your actual work. Either in your specific client channel on slack or in #general (the tavern). You can either share a work sample, or tell us something you've learned or are struggling with, or some 3rd party work that inspires you. Shooting a quick [screen cap video]() to share is a neat idea. [Courtesy](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
  * Give honest feedback on some other team member's posts. [Collaboration](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
  * Fill your timesheet (end of the day) [Courtesy](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
  * Check your company Email. [Courtesy](../FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)

## Every Week
  * Communicate with each client you are working with. Send them an update on what's done and what's pending out of their current expectations. Include a link to staged work, and a screenshot or video. It's best to do this Friday or Monday. [Transparency](../TRANSPARENCY.md)

## Do Not
  * Use priviate messages for things that don't need to be private. Share your experiences on your projects in your client channel, and if it's more widely applicable, in #general. [Transparency](../TRANSPARENCY.md)
