# Scrum

Countable uses [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage work delivery. Its a framework for helping teams learn to solve problems together. Check out the guide book from the inventor of [Scrum] here(https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

## Project Goal
Every project should have a purpose set at the outset. This is a clearly written goal discussed with the team to ensure clarity, and is used by the Product Owner to order the Backlog.

## Sprint
A sprint is a period (usually 1 week) during which:
1. We choose some items from the backlog to finish at our sprint plan meeting. Determine if last week's work was effective, had a big impact, and how to do better.
2. We work all week to finish those chosen items.
3. We release (ship) our work to real customers at the end of the sprint.
4. Go back to #1 above for another sprint plan.

## Roles
These are the duties we must assigned when doing Scrum.

### Product Owner
Orders the backlog (decides what's important to work, considering input from team). Makes sure items in the backlog are clear. Te product owner is often our client.

### Scrum Master
  * Trains the team on Scrum and makes sure we're following the rules of scrum effectively (shipping each week, continuously learning, making tickets clear)
  * Find problems in workflow and make them visible for the team to work together on during the Sprint Plan meeting.
  * Chair the sprint meeting, asking good questions in order to understand our progress towards the project goal.

### Developers (and other technicians)
  * Ensures they have a challenging yet doable amount of work in their sprint each sprint.
  * Takes care to understand items in their sprint.
  * Takes responsibility for shipping the work each sprint.

## Backlog
A list of all the actions we current believe will accomplish the goal of our project. This should be ordered by impact to effort ratio. That is, items which make the biggest difference in the least time should be done first.
 
We do not have daily stand-up meetings since our team works in different timezones. Instead, we have a slack channel where people should communicate about what they're working on, coordinate code reviews, and figure out logistics to ship their work every week, and generate ideas for the sprint plan meeting.

Note: Instead of just talking about what did you do this week, try to use a screen share feature to walk along all of your "done" trello tickets, explaining one by one. This helps the team to better understand all of your work.
