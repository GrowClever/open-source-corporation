# Scrum

Countable uses [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage work delivery. Its a framework for helping teams learn to solve problems together. Check out the guide book from the inventor of [Scrum] here(https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

#### Backlog
A list of all the actions we current believe will accomplish the goal of our project. This should be ordered by impact to effort ratio. That is, items which make the biggest difference in the least time should be done first.

#### Sprint
A sprint is a period (usually 1 week) during which:
1. We choose some items from the backlog to finish at our sprint plan meeting. Determine if last week's work was effective, had a big impact, and how to do better.
2. We work all week to finish those chosen items.
3. We release (ship) our work to real customers at the end of the sprint.
4. Go back to #1 above for another sprint plan.
 
We do not have daily stand-up meetings since our team works in different timezones. Instead, we have a slack channel where people should communicate about what they're working on, coordinate code reviews, and figure out logistics to ship their work every week, and generate ideas for the sprint plan meeting.

For a visual aid of how our work is processed, see this [Business Process Diagram](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VrniT1lRqVu9sJr0ZMK1aQLnFwEuFIQD).

Note: Instead of just talking about what did you do this week, try to use a screen share feature to walk along all of your "done" trello tickets, explaining one by one. This helps the team to better understand all of your work.
