# Scrum

Countable uses [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) to manage work delivery. Its a framework for helping teams learn to solve problems together. Check out the guide book from the inventor of Scrum [here](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

## Purpose

Learn how to achieve [Key Results](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/OKRS.md) together.

## Scope

Define how Countable does Scrum.

## Process

### Project Objective and Key Results

Every project should have an [Objective](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/OKRS.md). This is a written goal discussed with the team to ensure clarity, and is used by the Product Owner to order the Backlog.

### Sprint
A sprint is a period (1 week to 1 month) during which:
1. Measure what % done our Key Results are 
2. Move the Trello Cards that best achieve the project's key results and no more than we can actually do.
2. We release (ship) our work to real customers at the end of the sprint.
3. Go to Step 1.

### Roles
These are the duties we must assigned when doing Scrum.

#### Product Owner
  * Develops User Stories by talking to real users and ensures those users' needs are being met by the team.
  * Clarifies how to achieve our [Key Results](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/blob/master/OKRS.md), while taking input from team.
  * Triage the Trello Requests column into an Ordered Backlog of work.
  * Makes sure items in the backlog are clear to developers. The product owner is typically our client.

#### Scrum Master
  * Chair the sprint meeting, asking good questions in order to understand our progress towards the project goal.
  * Trains the team on Scrum and makes sure we're following the rules of scrum effectively (shipping each week, continuously learning, making tickets clear)
  * Find problems in workflow and make them visible for the team to work together on during the Sprint Plan meeting.

#### Developers (and other technicians)
  * Ensures they have a challenging yet doable amount of work in their sprint each sprint.
  * Takes care to understand items in their sprint.
  * Takes responsibility for shipping the work each sprint.

### Backlog

The Backlog is a list of all the actions we current believe will accomplish the goal of our project. This should be ordered by impact to effort ratio. That is, items which make the biggest difference in the least time should be done first.
 
We do not have daily stand-up meetings since our team works in different timezones. Instead, we have a slack channel where people should communicate about what they're working on, coordinate code reviews, and figure out logistics to ship their work every week, and generate ideas for the sprint plan meeting.

Note: Instead of just talking about what did you do this week, try to use a screen share feature to walk along all of your "done" trello tickets, explaining one by one. This helps the team to better understand all of your work.
