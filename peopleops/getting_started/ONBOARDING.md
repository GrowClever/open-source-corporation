# Onboarding

## Welcome to Countable!

The goal of this guide is to help new members of Countable get connect with the team, efficiently set up accounts, and learn key things to help you get started contributing! If you find a way to improve this document, send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/countable-web/open-source-corporation/pull/new/master)! If anything is unclear, let's fix it so it's clear for the next person.

  * Get a countable.ca email address (ask your manager to create it), and [set up your signature](https://youtu.be/hA5cRIDg0Ko)
  * Use your email address to [sign up on our slack](https://join.slack.com/t/countable-web/signup).
  * Use our slack to say hi to the team. Share your:
     * New Title
     * Last Company
     * Hometown
     * School
     * Hobbies
     * Two True things about you, and a Lie (let the team guess which).
  * Use the team to answer your other questions.
  * Add your approximate work availability here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zh6GYex7UtoZGyChRGNy8378brtxvfrOdtedf6z5c5M/edit#gid=0

### Set up a Timesheet

  * Make your own copy of [this sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kPxAPNnCAWGFag1zHUttEtScNnVE3gQRjt0wQEFbpwI) and share full access with your manager only. Name the file `<your name>-<year, 4 digits>-timesheet`.
  * Filling out your timesheet every day is required. Separate clients or projects go on separate lines, so you may have 3 lines for a single day.
  * Describe the work in a few words that indicate specific outcomes you worked on for most of that day, in a language clients will understand. Between 3 and 20 words is the right level of detail. If you're entering the same phrase every day, you're not being specific enough.
  * If you don't know the project, put "Countable" in that column.
  * Also include at least one of: references to issues in Trello, Commit IDs.
  * Countable pays for your time training and learning things you need for your job.
  * If you're not sure what's billable, generally anything we ask you to do is billable, and anything we "invite" you to do is optional and not billable. Training is only billable if it's requested by the company that you complete specific materials, or you're learning something immediately required to solve a problem in your work. Attending events, conferences, etc, is not paid unless we require you to go for marketing or another purpose (but we'll often pay for your tickets in any case).

### Team Calendar
  * Go to calendar.google.com from your Countable Google Apps account.
  * You should see our team calendar with meetings to attend.
  * When you are travelling, create an event indicating your time away and whether you're working 50% or 0%.

### Payment Info
  * Provide a void cheque (in Canada this includes your bank account number, routing/transit number and institution number) to our accounting staff.

### Environment
  * Set up a [physical space and equipment](./PHYSICAL_SETUP.md) to work.
  * Read about our [ops](../../product/engineering/OPERATIONS.md) and [coding standards](../../product/engineering/CODING_STANDARDS.md).
  * Complete the [training exercises](../../product/engineering/TRAINING.md) following these practices and get a team member to code review it using a feature branch and pull request.
  * Order a book that will help you learn your job, and bill the company for it.

Share your username with your manager on these platforms so you can be invited into specific projects:

### How to Do Work

Skim this so you know the language and how we work [Project Management](./PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md).

### Confirm

You should now go on the slack #general channel and announce that you've completed onboarding, or we'll assume you haven't and complain.

### When You Start
  * Skim this entire manual and take notes so you know what's in here.
  * If something *specific to our company* isn't in here, ask team mates for help liberally and ensure it gets documented concisely in the right place.
  * Before you ask for help on technical work: Google it; do your research and try every reasonable simple step to narrow it down; Look in our documentation; Finally, ask as specific a question you can.
  * As a new person, your job is mostly to catch balls (not pass them on or throw them to others). So, try to execute work quickly, save others time as opposed to costing their time. Remember, you're already using time on the above items (teaching, documentation, and support) but these are a very good use of their time. So, don't be shy to ask for help, but do so respectfully and consciously of the other party's time.
  * Review the [staff homepage](https://sites.google.com/countable.ca/countable-staff/home), for commonly used resources including the Google Drive stuff you can access. Sign in as countable email to view this page. 

### How to ask for help:
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY14Er6JX2s, skip to 11 minute mark and watch steps for asking for help. Summary.
  * If you struggle more than 15 mins, ask for help. (if you're waiting for a response, move to something else meanwhile.)
  * Demonstrate competence - Be clear. 
  * Indicate what % done you are on the project. "I'm 30% done this, and stuck on X. I already tried A and B."
  * Show what you've already tried.
  * After you get a response, say it back to the mentor to demonstrate your understanding.
