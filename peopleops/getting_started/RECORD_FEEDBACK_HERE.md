# Staff Feedback

If you're not sure where to add your thoughts, put them here.

Captured feedback from employees on how we can improve. Discuss these in team meetings.

1. Better requirements clarity.
2. Allocate resources to train new staff.
3. Implement some engineering as marketing projects.
4. Include clarity on stock options in partner track.
5. Sometimes I wish we had more documentation regarding each project, something stating the project's scope, deadlines, contacts, useful links (to the project or client's website), list of emails (stakeholders), that kind of stuff. I usually have to take notes right after a meeting so I won't forget what we discussed.
