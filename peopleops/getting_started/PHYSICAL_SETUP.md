You'll need:

  * Good quality headset with mic. ie, [these](https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Microphone-Cancelling-Lightweight-Headphones/dp/B06XWG12QS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1531614591&sr=8-2&keywords=headset+wired+-wireless#customerReviews)
  * A computer. If you're a developer, it should have either Linux or MacOS (don't use Windows for work). If you're a developer or designer, you want 4GB or more of RAM, 128GB or more of disk, and a core i3 or better CPU. We recommend dell XPS 9350, 9360, 9370. We recommend Ubuntu LTS or Elementary OS. The latter has been found to be more stable in some cases on the Dell machines mentioned above.
  * A quiet, hopefully cool, room to work from with a stable internet connection. When you `ping 8.8.8.8` you should get no dropped packets or numbers over 100ms.
