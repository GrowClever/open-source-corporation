## Benefits

We don't currently have an extended medical group insurance plan (partly as we don't have USA employees who tend to be more reliant on this), but we'd like to help out a little when our team has dental or other uninsured medical costs. In the future, we plan to improve our coverage of medical costs but this is a start.

1. Full time contractors (100h/mo or more) and employees receive 50% reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per year.
2. Part time contractors (50h/mo or more) receive 30% reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per year.
3. Payment will be included like other expenses, alongside payroll.
